Yet despite the challenges, volatility and uncertainty we saw in th e \\nmarkets, this was also the year that we at DWS concluded Phase One of our corporate journey as a listed company. Last year, \\nwe realized the benefits of our clear corporate action and decision making that have epitomized our efforts over the last two \\nyears. We achieved record results across our key performance indicators and, at the same time, reached our ambitious medium-\\nterm targets that we set at our IPO, one year earlier than planned.  \\nOur adjusted profit before tax was € 795 million –  a record high for DWS – which was 3 percent higher than the previous record \\nset in 2019 and 27 percent higher than 2018. After tax, our net profit  stood at € 558 million, a rise of 9 percent from 2019. Based \\non this, we propose to the Annual General Meeting an increased dividend of € 1.81 per share for the financial year 2020, \\ndelivering on another target set during our IPO of a dividend payout ratio of between 65 to 75 percent. In addition, we achieved \\nan adjusted cost-income ratio of 64.5 percent, our lowest level on record after reducing our cost base by 11 percent year- on-year, \\nand hitting our target of below 65 percent already in 2020 ahead of sc hedule. Annual net inflows exceeded € 30 billion in 2020 –  \\nalso a record – with inflows reported across all regions, including liquid and illiquid asset classes and from both retail and \\ninstitutional clients. This translates to 4 percent net flows, which is in line with our target of between 3 to 5 percent. Contributing \\nimmensely, our ESG-dedicated funds continued to attract strong investor interest, accounting for 30 percent of our total annual \\nnet inflows in 2020.  \\nAs a firm, we have placed ESG at the heart of everything that we do. And this was evidenced throughout 2020 as the COVID-19 \\npandemic caused unprecedented hardships for societies, economies and people at large. As a firm, DWS Group took immediate \\naction, giving to organizations all around the world to help feed and shelter those most in need. These efforts will continue  – and \\nour collective desire to help the communities in which we operate is embedded in our DNA, both as a fiduciary and as a \\ncorporate. And having previously identified ESG as one of the key mega-trends shaping the next decade  – an assessment further \\nunderscored by the pandemic – we worked intensively to implement a comprehensive ESG strategy as we see it becoming a \\ndominant theme for our investors, clients and regulators alike. We established a Group Sustainability Office to oversee a coherent \\nand holistic ESG strategy firm-wide. We secured the support of high-calibre external experts for our new ESG Advisory Board. \\nAnd we enhanced both our ESG integration as well as our stewardship efforts with the introduction of Smart Integration into the \\ninvestment process. Additionally, we publicly committed to becoming climate-neutral in our actions as a corporate and a fiduciary, \\nbecoming a founding signatory of the Net Zero Emissions initiative of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change.  \\nAlongside our ESG focus, we also paid particular attention to our professional responsibilities. We prioritized our fiduciary work \\nfor our clients and, naturally, the safety and well-being of our people. At the same time, we also continued to drive progress on \\nthe execution of our strategic development during 2020. Our laser focus on cost discipline and on investment performance were \\ncrucial, and we simplified our global business structure to become even more client-focused, flexible, efficient and effective. As \\npart of this, we established a dedicated Product Division, reflecting our culture as a true fiduciary asset manager. \\nFurthermore, we strengthened relationships with a number of strategic pa rtners which have been invaluable to DWS’s \\ndevelopment, renewing our partnership commitment with Zurich Insurance Group in Germany until 2032, and entering new \\npartnerships with Eurovita in Italy and Northwestern Mutual Capital in the United States. Also last year, we acquired a minority \\nstake in Arabesque AI, as we look to incorporate the technology of tomorrow, Artificial Intelligence, into our investment processes. \\nMeanwhile, our other long-standing strategic partnerships have contributed significantly to our success. \\nWith our key achievements of 2020, we delivered on what we committed to you, our valued shareholders. And while we are proud \\nof all we were able to deliver during Phase One, we are determined to build on this momentum with Phase Two of our corporate \\njourney. We feel confident about our business and our firm’s place within the asset management industry –  and the challenges it \\nfaces – as the industry is pushed out of its comfort zone. As we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, the work we have done over the \\nlast 24 months forms the starting point for the high ambitions we are now pursuing. In this next phase, we have set clear \\npriorities: Investing in transformation to remain efficient; focusing on and investing in targeted areas to deliver profitable growth; \\nand aiming for leadership in our industry in areas of strength from across our diversified business, including ESG, Passive a nd \\nhigh-margin strategies. Collectively, these will help us to grow our business as we look to take an active role in the consolidation \\nof the market. In short, our goal for Phase Two: Transform, Grow and Lead. \\n DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\nLetter from the Chairman of the Executive Board\\n  \\n\\nVII\\n \\nIn 2021 and beyond, we will transform ourselves to meet the industry challenges of this decade and the era that lies ahead. This \\nincludes doing everything we can, to continue to strengthen our asset management focused approach. We are developing and \\ninvesting in a standalone core platform, including an IT and policy framework, tailored to our fiduciary business and our clients, \\nwhile integrating Artificial Intelligence into the way we work. The use of data and algorithms will improve investment managers in \\ntheir decision making in the future. And with the help of automation, the processes will also become more seamless. Within ou r \\norganization, we will embark on a cultural transformation that is performance-driven and a clear meritocracy, helping us attract \\nthe best talent from a wide range of profiles and backgrounds. This will be underpinned by our newly implemented Functional \\nRole Framework, in which we will introduce flat hierarchies to ensure every voice is heard at DWS.  \\nWe will also invest to grow – in businesses and areas where we believe we can lead our industry, building on our strengths and \\nexpertise. We will invest in high-margin asset classes and products in the Active and Alternatives space, such as Real Estate, \\nInfrastructure and more, on one side, as well as into our scalable Passive business, especially in ETFs, on the other side. We are \\nequally committed to expanding our client base. For us, this means further leveraging existing partnerships  – and finding new \\nones – especially in the growth region of Asia, with a clear focus on China. And finally, we will invest in product innovations in \\nESG so that we can position ourselves as the go-to one-stop-shop ESG investment manager.  \\nCollectively, I am convinced that these efforts will help us to become an industry leader across the board. We want to lead t he \\nasset management sector in ESG, both as a fiduciary and as a corporate, and that is why, from now on, all our new product \\ninitiatives will by default be ESG. We want to become a leader in the all-important Passive space, especially in Europe, as well as \\na leader in high-margin businesses, expanding on our market position in thematic equities, multi-asset and Alternatives.  \\nLooking forward, we are setting new medium-term financial targets to ensure that we remain focused on delivering profitable \\ngrowth, and achieving our aspiration to become a leading European asset manager with a global reach, a global presence and a \\nglobal footprint. In this respect, our adjusted cost-income ratio will remain key to making sure we maximize shareholder value for \\nyou while we balance efficiency and investments. This is why we commit to further reducing our adjusted cost-income ratio to \\n60 percent by 2024. In addition, we are also upgrading our net flow target to more than 4 percent on average in the medium term. \\nWe are confident that we can achieve these even higher net inflows over the coming years, supported by our global and \\ndiversified portfolio, and driven by continued strong client demand for our ESG-dedicated funds and new product launches. Our \\npeople – who deserve great thanks for their tremendous efforts in Phase One of our corporate journey  – will ensure with passion \\nand dedication that Phase Two will be equally successful.  \\nTo conclude, and hoping that circumstances will allow for a face-to -face event once again, I would like to invite you to attend our \\nAnnual General Meeting on Wednesday, June 9, 2021 in Frankfurt/Main.  \\nPlease stay healthy and safe. I look forward to seeing you in person as soon as possible. \\nDr Asoka Woehrmann, CEO\\n DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\nExecutive Board\\n  \\n\\nVIII\\n \\nManaging Directors of the General Partner  \\n(collectively referred to as the Executive Board) \\nDr Asoka Woehrmann, * 1965 \\nChief Executive Officer and Head of CEO Division (since October 25,  2018) \\n\\nManfred Bauer, * 1969 \\nHead of Product Division (since July 1. 2020) \\n\\nMark Cullen, * 1955 \\nChief Operating Officer and Head of COO Division (since December 1,  2018) \\n\\nDirk Goergen, * 1981 \\nHead of Client Coverage Division (since December 1, 2018) \\n\\nStefan Kreuzkamp, * 1966 \\nChief Investment Officer and Head of Investment Division (since March 1, 2018) \\n\\nClaire Peel, * 1974 \\nChief Financial Officer and Head of CFO Division (since March 1,  2018) \\n\\nExecutive Board in the reporting year: \\nDr Asoka Woehrmann, * 1965 \\nChief Executive Officer and Head of CEO Division (since October 25, 2018) \\nManfred Bauer, * 1969 \\nHead of Product Division (since July 1, 2020) \\nPierre Cherki, * 1966 \\nCo-Head Investment Group (from March 1, 2018 until June 9, 2020) \\nMark Cullen, * 1955 \\nChief Operating Officer and Head of COO Division (since December 1, 2018) \\nDirk Goergen, * 1981 \\nHead of Client Coverage Division (since December 1, 2018) \\nRobert Kendall, * 1974 \\nCo-Head Global Coverage Group (from March 1, 2018 until June 9, 2020) \\nStefan Kreuzkamp, * 1966 \\nChief Investment Officer and Head of Investment Division (since March 1, 2018) \\nClaire Peel, * 1974 \\nChief Financial Officer and Head of CFO Division (since March 1, 2018) \\nNikolaus von Tippelskirch, * 1971 \\nChief Control Officer (from March 1, 2018 until June 9, 2020) DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n  \\n\\nIX\\n \\nReport of the Supervisory Board \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented global and local challenges of unprecedented levels in the fiscal year 2020. Against this \\nbackdrop, the DWS business model has not only demonstrated its stability and resilience, but DWS has also laid further \\ngroundwork for a sustainable and growth-oriented strategy for the future. Thanks to its focus on client needs and efficiency, DWS \\nsucceeded in achieving a record adjusted profit before tax in the full year 2020 and recorded more net new inflows than ever \\nbefore. Total global Assets under Management reached record highs while the total adjusted cost-income ratio fell to a new low. \\nAs a result, the ambitious strategic goals from the IPO in 2018 were achieved one year earlier than planned.  \\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank all DWS employees for their commitment and dedication in this \\nparticularly challenging year. Our thanks also go to the Executive Board, who successfully led the company through these difficult \\ntimes. \\nAt the same time, DWS has evolved as an organization and is well prepared to successfully meet the requirements of a changing \\nenvironment. The Supervisory Board, the Joint Committee and the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner created a new, \\nsimplified and globally integrated business structure in June 2020, including personnel changes and reorganizing global \\nresponsibilities on the level of the Executive Board. \\nThe way we work has also changed dramatically over the past year. This applies to the employees of DWS as well as to us as \\nthe Supervisory Board. While the latest version of the German Corporate Governance Code as of December 16, 2019, still states \\nthat participation in supervisory board meetings via video conference should not be the standard, it has in fact become \\nunavoidable since March 2020. Thanks in part to digital progress, this has worked unexpectedly well. However, we hope for us as \\nthe Supervisory Board, the Executive Board, the employees, clients and shareholders of DWS, that we can soon meet again in \\nperson. \\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board continued to advise and support the Executive Board intensively on the strategic direction of \\nDWS. Shortly after the announcement of the organizational changes in June 2020, the Supervisory Board held its annual two-day \\nstrategy meeting with the new management team. Targeted growth ambitions and strategies to sustain efficiency were discussed \\nand developed while future visions for digital innovation and ESG were also addressed in depth. In addition, the new \\nunderstanding of corporate responsibility shaped by the pandemic was examined in detail. To ensure DWS is strongly positioned \\nto address the mega trends that are shaping the asset management industry, the Supervisory Board and Executive Board \\nintensively evaluated and developed the future program centred on transformation, growth and leadership. This strategy was later \\nconfirmed as part of the planning process. \\nIn the second half of the year, the Supervisory Board also dealt intensively with the effects of the collapse of Wirecard AG \\n(Wirecard) on the DWS Group. Wirecard’s breakdown had deeply shaken the German stock market, the financial sector and the \\nasset management industry in June 2020. \\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board dealt with fundamental questions relating to corporate management and organization as well \\nas compliance and control and addressed the governance standards implemented by DWS. \\nThe Supervisory Board performed the tasks assigned to it by law, regulatory requirements, the company’s Articles of Associati on \\nand the Supervisory Board’s Terms of Reference. In fulfilling its supervisory tasks, it monitored the General Partner and advi sed \\nthe Executive Board. Besides the monitoring of the ongoing business operations, the Supervisory Board\\'s deliberations primari ly \\ncentred on the strategic development of DWS as well as on business events and transactions with significant relevance for the \\ncompany and on key personnel-related matters. \\nThe Supervisory Board had the Executive Board regularly report to it both in writing and in person on significant matters relating \\nto the company. Moreover, there was a regular exchange of information between the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the \\nchairpersons of its committees and the Executive Board. Thus, the Supervisory Board was continuously, comprehensively and \\nwithout delay informed on business development and the company’s strategy, its corporate, financial and personnel planning, i ts \\nprofitability, the control framework and its environment, including the company’s compliance  and its risk, liquidity and capital \\nmanagement. \\n DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n  \\n\\nX\\n \\nThere were a total of 18 meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. The average meeting participation rate in 2020 \\nwas above 96%. Information on meeting participation for each member on the Supervisory Board is laid out in the following \\nsection. When necessary, resolutions were passed by circular procedure between the meetings. \\nMeetings of the Supervisory Board in Plenum \\nThe Supervisory Board held seven meetings in the course of 2020, where it dealt with all matters of significant relevance to the \\ncompany. \\nAt its first meeting on January 27, 2020, the Supervisory Board reviewed the 2019 full year financial performance and discuss ed \\nplan deviations, the current business development, existing projections, and agreed targets. Further, the Supervisory Board, \\nbased on the Audit and Risk Committee’s deliberations, examined the dividend capacity of DWS Group and concurred with the \\nExecutive Board’s dividend proposal. The Supervisory Board also dealt with the  Annual Internal Audit Report as well as the \\nExecutive Board’s short- and longer term strategy to minimise the impact of Brexit on DWS Group . Moreover, the Executive \\nBoard laid out its plan for implementing a standalone, state- of-the art technology infrastructure. It presented a feasibility study and \\nthe Supervisory Board supported the Executive Board’s proposal to conduct a detailed due diligence. Finally, the Supervisory \\nBoard agreed to a proposal put forward by the Nomination Committee to amend the objectives regarding its composition and \\nresolved to add “expert knowledge of ESG standards and best practices and their implementation” to its profile of requirement s. \\nAt its extraordinary meeting on March 18, 2020, the Supervisory Board reviewed the 2019 Annual Financial Statements and \\nConsolidated Financial Statements as well as the integrated non-financial group statement for 2019 and the Dependency Report \\npresented by the Executive Board. Based on the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, and following an extensive \\ndiscussion with representatives of the auditor KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin (KPMG), the Supervisory Board \\nunanimously approved (‘billigt’) the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements. In addi tion, the \\nSupervisory Board concurred with the proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of distributable profit and resolved the \\nReport of the Supervisory Board. Separately, the Supervisory Board received a report on immediate management actions taken \\nin relation to the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic and financial market developments. The Executive Board presented its \\nbusiness continuity plans as well as risk management measures to mitigate potential liquidity, counterparty and market risk and \\nthe global health and safety protocol. \\nOn April 10, 2020, Mr Ozeki stepped down from his office as shareholders’ representative on the Supervisory Board.  \\nAt the Supervisory Board meeting on April 27, 2020, the COVID-19 impact on DWS Group was examined in further detail. The \\nExecutive Board reported on operational stability  and strict control function monitoring of the adapted internal procedures . Further \\nto additional measures to promote operational efficiency and cost management, new opportunities of strategic relevance for \\nDWS, in particular in the areas ESG and digitalization were highlighted. Dr Woehrmann outlined required strategic adjustments to \\nembrace new realities and the Group’s response to changing investor behaviour. In the light of the pand emic and the German \\ngovernmental ban on public gatherings, the Supervisory Board decided, based on a proposal by the General Partner, to postpone \\nthe Annual General Meeting, originally planned for June 18, 2020, to a date in the fourth quarter of the year. The decision was \\nmade to protect the health of shareholders, employees and service providers while at the same time maintaining the possibility of \\na physical shareholders’ meeting in 2020. In addition, the Supervisory Board evaluated new measures identifi ed by the Executive \\nBoard to mitigate interest rate sensitivity, including the purchase of German sub-sovereign bonds with ultra-long maturity as an \\ninstrument to further diversify credit risk and at the same time proxy hedge the interest rate risk of the  Group’s Guaranteed \\nProducts. \\nOn May 25, 2020, the Chairman discussed with the member of the Supervisory Board the simplified business structure developed \\nby the Management Board in consultation with the company’s governance bodies and the changes to the le adership team \\nplanned by the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner.  \\nOn July 21, 2020, Mr Bernd Leukert was appointed by the court as shareholders’ representative, succeeding Ms Sylvie Matherat,  \\nuntil the end of the Annual General Meeting 2020. Mr Leukert had previously been nominated for this position by the \\nshareholders’ representatives on the Supervisory Board, based on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee.   \\nAt its meeting on July 24, 2020, the Supervisory Board addressed management actions taken in relation to the Wirecard \\ninsolvency. Initial information on Wirecard’s breakdown had been provided by the Executive Board  on June 18, 2020, and on \\nJune 19, 2020, and during an extraordinary meeting of the Audit and Risk Committee on June  24, 2020. The Supervisory Board \\nexamined reports from the Executive Board and the control functions on the development of Wirecard exposure in DWS \\ninvestment products. In addition, the Supervisory Board dealt with the Wirecard impact on Ernst & Young GmbH \\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (EY), which had previously been identified as the preferred new statutory auditor for the financial  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n  \\n\\nXI\\n \\nyear 2020, based on a voluntary audit tendering procedure conducted in 2018 . In light of EY’s role as statutory auditor of \\nWirecard, the Supervisory Board decided to re-assess its earlier preference. The Audit and Risk Committee was asked for its \\nsupport and for a recommendation to the Supervisory Board. Separately, the Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board \\nabout strategic considerations for the repositioning of the Group’s investment account services business and the examination of \\npotential joint venture opportunities in the fund platform segment. The Supervisory Board also examined and approved the \\nGeneral Partner’s reimbursement and remuneration for 2019. The shareholders’ representatives on the Super visory Board \\ndelegated Mr Minoru Kimura to the Joint Committee, subject to his appointment by the court. Mr Kimura had previously been \\nproposed to succeed Mr Hiroshi Ozeki on the Supervisory Board, based on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. \\nOn August 10, 2020, Mr Kimura was appointed by the court as shareholders’ representative on the Supervisory Board until the \\nend of the Annual General Meeting 2020. \\nTaking into account the infection situation in Germany, the Supervisory Board prepared the invitation to the virtual Annual \\nGeneral Meeting on November 18, 2020, and approved the proposals for the agenda, including the proposal of the auditor for th e \\nfinancial year 2020 at an extraordinary meeting on August 18, 2020. Despite its earlier preference for EY, based on the \\nrecommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Supervisory Board decided to propose that shareholders vote in favour of \\nremaining with the current auditor and renewing the appointment of KPMG. This decision was made in an abundance of caution \\nand under due consideration to avoid any possible future conflicts arising potentially from EY’s role as statutory auditor of  \\nWirecard. \\nOn September 2 and 3, 2020, the Supervisory Board hosted its annual strategy offsite with participation from the Executive \\nBoard. The Supervisory Board reviewed DWS Group’s achievements versus its 2020 strategic agenda and further examined and \\nprovided advice on the strategic priorities for 2021. In this context, challenges, trends and opportunities as well as financial and \\nnon-financial targets were discussed and reviewed in detail. All members of the Supervisory Board attended the two day \\nworkshop which resulted in a total of 14 specific actions, which are since being implemented by the Executive Board.  \\nAt its meeting on October 26, 2020, the Supervisory Board dealt with further aspects of the Wirecard collapse, including the \\nresults of a targeted review of the relevant processes and risk monitoring controls by Internal Audit. It also addressed measures \\nfor the recovery of losses incurred by DWS investment funds as a consequence of the Wirecard fraud, in particular, the \\nregistration of claims in the insolvency proceedings. Ther e was a review of the status of DWS Group’s IT transformational \\nprogram and the Supervisory Board examined opportunities and challenges as well as the targeted implementation timeline and \\nnext steps. Further, the Supervisory Board revisited the requirements set out by the German Act Implementing the Second EU \\nShareholder Rights Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der zweiten Aktionärsrechterichtlinie - ARUG II) in relation to the regular \\nvote of the General Meeting on the approval (“Billigung”) of the remunerat ion system for the Executive Board, which becomes \\nobligatory starting from 2021. Moreover, the Executive Board provided an outlook on the Financial Plan for 2021 to 2023, \\nincluding further actions to lessen the impact of guaranteed products on capital demand. Further agenda items included the kick \\noff of the Supervisory Board’s annual efficiency review and a discussion of the priorities for 2021.  \\nOn November 18, 2020, the Annual General Meeting elected Mr Leukert and Mr Kimura as shareholders’ representativ es on the \\nSupervisory Board, following the recommendations of the Supervisory Board and the Nomination Committee. \\nAt the meeting on December 11, 2020, the Executive Board presented an analysis of the internal investment management, \\ncorporate governance, customer service and product development processes, as well as related controls, compared to market \\nstandards and best practices. This assessment had been conducted with the support of an external consultant and focussed on \\nthe German and Luxembourg operations. Further, the Executive Board presented measures for the continuous improvement of \\nthe internal risk warning systems. The Executive Board reported that preparations for the transformation to a standalone IT a nd \\noperating platform had been completed. In this context, the Executive Board also referred to Deutsche Bank Group’s cloud \\nstrategy and outlined the respective measures taken by DWS Group. Shortly prior to the end of the transition period on December \\n31, 2020, the Supervisory Board also examined the completion of the Brexit program. Moreover, the Supervisory Board dealt with \\nthe Financial Plan for DWS Group, which had earlier been approved by the Executive Board and addressed the remuneration \\nsystem for the Executive Board as well as planned enhancements. In this context, the legal requirements of the German Stock \\nCorporation Act on the remuneration system were discussed. In addition, the Supervisory Board reviewed the overall course of \\nthe Annual General Meeting 2020, the general debate, shareholders ’ main areas of interest and voting behaviour.  Furthermore, \\nan amendment of the Supervisory Board’s profile, specifically an amendment to the targeted number of independent \\nshareholders’ representatives was agreed. The Supervisory Board determined that at least five shareholders’ representatives \\nshall be independent from the company and the Executive Board and at least five shareholders’ representatives shall be \\nindependent from the controlling shareholder. Finally, the Supervisory Board resolved the Declaration of Conformity according to \\nSection 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act.   DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n  \\n\\nXII\\n \\nThe Committees of the Supervisory Board \\nAudit and Risk Committee \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee held eight meetings in 2020. It supported the Supervisory Board in monitoring the financial \\nreporting process and intensively addressed the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as \\nthe interim report and the audit and review reports issued by the independent auditor.  \\nWithin the context of financial reporting and accounting practices, the committee reviewed the valuation of goodwill and other \\nintangible assets and the impairment testing of certain intangible assets. In this regard, the committee put special focus on the \\nqualitative and quantitative impairment tests performed for the Scudder intangible asset. Further, the committee addressed \\nservice fees charged by Deutsche Bank AG and its subsidiaries and respective governance processes. \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee monitored the effectivenes s of the DWS Group’s risk management system in particular in relation \\nto the internal control system and internal audit. Against the background of the Wirecard fraud case and losses suffered by \\ninvested DWS funds, the committee examined the compliance with internal guidelines and regulatory requirements. Further, the \\ncommittee was continuously informed about COVID-19 related crisis management activities. In this regard, the committee \\naddressed the Group’s approach towards information and cyber security and  related controls for all relevant threat scenarios.     \\nIn addition, the committee dealt with the DWS Group risk appetite statement and the overarching risk strategy, embedded in th e \\nRisk Management Framework. It regularly examined reports addressing key metrics and risk appetite, investment risk, financial \\nrisk and model risk. Further, the committee addressed credit and counterparty risk and examined the processes established by \\nDWS Group to govern co-investments and seed capital investments. The committee also continued to address the impact of \\nlower long-term interest rates on the Group and discussed related management actions with the Chief Risk Officer. In this \\ncontext, the committee closely and continuously monitored the measures to mitigate the  interest rate sensitivity of the Group’s \\nGuaranteed Products, including the investment into German sub-sovereign bonds as a proxy hedge for Economic Risk.  \\nSeparately, the committee dealt with the Annual Internal Audit Report and the Annual Compliance Report. Further, the committee \\nwas regularly informed on the work of internal audit, the audit plan and its findings. It also addressed the measures taken by the \\nExecutive Board to remediate deficiencies identified by the internal control functions and the auditor and it received regular \\nupdates on the status and progress made in this context.  \\nThe Group Controller updated the Audit and Risk Committee regularly on the status of the implementation of rules governing \\nrelated party transactions, which came into effect in January 2020. In this context, the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the \\ninternal procedures to meet the requirements to identify, approve and disclose material related party transactions pursuant t o \\nSection 111b of the German Stock Corporation Act. As the committee had been appointed by the Supervisory Board to resolve \\non reserved matters in relation to material related party transactions, it requested regular progress reports on the activities of the \\nRelated Party Transaction Council set up for support. In 2020 there were no material related party transactions for approval and \\ndisclosure. \\nDue to EY’s role as statutory auditor of Wirecard, the Audit and Risk Committee re-evaluated the results of the voluntary auditor \\ntender procedures carried out in 2017 / 2018. Following a comprehensive qualitative assessment of alternative options, the \\ncommittee concluded to deviate from its earlier preference for EY as the statutory auditor for 2020. This decision was made as a \\nprecautionary measure to avoid any potential future conflicts arising from the collapse of Wirecard. The Audit and Risk Committee \\nrecommended to the Supervisory Board a renewal of KPMG’s audit engagement for 2020. The preference for KPMG was based \\non the audit firm’s asset management expert ise, which was seen as beneficial for an efficient audit process. \\nFollowing KPMG’s appointment by the Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board issued the mandate to the independent \\nauditor and, with the support of the Audit and Risk Committee, set the amount of the auditor’s remuneration. KPMG also review ed \\nthe Dependency Report and performed a review to obtain a limited assurance of the integrated non-financial group statement \\nwithin the Summarized Management Report. The Audit and Risk Committee dealt with the measures to prepare for the audit of \\nthe Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for 2020, specified its own areas of focus for the audit \\nand approved a list of permissible non-audit services. The Audit and Risk Committee received regular reports on the engagement \\nof accounting firms, including the auditor, for non-audit-related services.  \\nRepresentatives of the independent auditor as well as the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief \\nControl Officer, or after implementation of the organizational changes the Chief Operating Officer,  and the Head of Internal Audit, \\nthe Group Controller and the Chief Risk Officer attended all of the meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee.

KPMG attended the committee’s meetings in the first and fourth quarter of  2020.  \\nRemuneration Committee \\nThe Remuneration Committee held two meetings in 2020. \\nThe committee supported the Supervisory Board in monitoring the appropriate structure of the compensation systems for DWS \\nGroup’s employees and, in particular, the appropri ate structure of the compensation for the Head of Compliance and for the \\nemployees who have material influence on the overall risk profile of the Group, i.e. Material Risk Takers. In this regard, th e \\ncommittee reviewed the DWS Compensation Policy and addressed changes to the compensation system, including a move \\ntowards a variable compensation that is more aligned with the Group’s targets.  \\nMoreover, the committee was informed about expected significant regulatory developments in 2021 and the anticipated impact on \\nthe Group’s compensation framework, including the adoption of the Capital Requirements Directive V into German law and the \\nplanned change of the definition of Material Risk Takers in the Investment Firm Regime. In this regard, the committee asked fo r \\nregular reports to review the regulatory-driven implementation at DWS Group and its implications on the employees.  \\nAdditionally, the committee addressed the new requirements set out by ARUG II whereby a regular AGM vote on the \\ncompensation system for the Executive Board becomes mandatory starting in 2021. In particular, the committee assessed the \\ncorresponding roles and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and the Remuneration Committee. \\nThe committee members also monitored the preparation for the 2020 year-end process and the governance around pay \\ndecisions, and received reports how these are carried out in line with Group policies. In addition, the committee monitored the \\nGroup’s cultural change program and plans to replace the current corporate ti tle system with a functional role framework to \\nsupport the transformation into a leaner, less hierarchical organisational structure. Since this project entered its implementation \\nphase at the end of 2020, the committee reviewed the preparations for the rollout of the framework.  \\nNomination Committee \\nThe Nomination Committee held one meeting in 2020. \\nThe committee prepared proposals for the election and appointment of new shareholders’ representatives to the Supervisory \\nBoard. In this context, the committee took into account statutory and regulatory requirements as well as the objectives for the \\ncomposition of the Supervisory Board and the required competence profile as previously defined. The Nomination Committee \\nalso prepared the proposals to amend the Supervisory Board’s profile of requirements.  \\nThe Nomination Committee supported the Supervisory Board’s own efficiency review, specifically evaluated the results of the \\nreview, identified areas of interest and made recommendations on potential action items.

The work in the bodies was characterized by an open and intensive exchange and \\na trustful cooperation. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the chairpersons of its committees coordinated their work a nd \\nconsulted each other regularly and – as required – on an ad-hoc basis in order to ensure the exchange of information required to \\nperform the tasks assigned to the Supervisory Board and its committees by law, administrative regulations, the Articles of \\nAssociation and the respective Terms of Reference. \\nAt the meetings of the Supervisory Board, the committee chairpersons reported regularly on the work of the committees. From \\ntime to time the representatives of the employees and the representatives of the shareholders conducted separate preliminary \\ndiscussions before the meetings of the Supervisory Board. At the beginning or end of the meeting of the Supervisory Board or its \\ncommittees, discussions were regularly held in executive sessions without the participation of the Executive Board. In accordance \\nwith the Terms of Reference of the Audit and Risk Committee the Supervisory Board determined that Ms Ute Wolf fulfils the \\nrequirements of Section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). \\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board determined that it has what it considers to be an adequate number of independent \\nshareholders’ representatives.   \\nThe Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), was resolved by the \\nSupervisory Board on December 11, 2020. The text of the Declaration of Conformity can be found in Section 3 of the Annual \\nReport. \\nTraining and Further Education Measures \\nIn 2020, there were continuous training measures with the Supervisory Board in plenum and its committees to further familiarize \\nthe members with DWS Group, the asset management industry and its regulatory environment . The members of the Supervisory \\nBoard continued to build and enhance required specialized knowledge to foster good corporate governance. Focus items \\nincluded the Group’s risk framework and related mitigation instruments, its cyber security strategy, sustainability standards  and \\ninvestors’ expectations, artificial intelligence in areas such as research and portfolio management, digitalization, the de velopment \\nof the European fund platform market, the Group’s pension system governance, macroeconomic developments as well as the \\nDWS CIO View.  \\nEducation measures took place both in form of introductory presentations prior to the deliberations of the Supervisory Board \\nduring its ordinary meetings and in separate dedicated training sessions. \\nInduction courses were held for new Supervisory Board members to facilitate their induction into office.

The Auditor’s Reports were signed by the Auditors Mr Kuppler and Mr \\nLehmann. Mr Kuppler was the Auditor responsible for the engagement.   \\nFurthermore, KPMG performed a review to obtain a limited assurance in the context of the integrated non-financial group \\nstatement in the Combined Management Report and issued an unqualified opinion. \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee examined the documents for the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial \\nStatements for 2020 as well as the Management Reports including the integrated non-financial group statement and the \\nDependency Report at its meeting on March 8, 2021. The representatives of KPMG provided the final report on the audit results . \\nThe Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee reported on this at the March 8, 2021 meeting of the Supervisory Board. Based \\non the recommendation and advance handling of the Audit and Risk Committee and after inspecting the Annual and Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements and Management Reports including the integrated non-financial group statement, the Supervisory Board \\nagreed to the results of the audits following an extensive discussion at the Supervisory Board and with representatives of KPMG. \\nThe Supervisory Board determined that, also based on the final results of its inspections, there are no objections to be raised. \\nOn March 8, 2021, the Supervisory Board approved the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements \\npresented by the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board  concurs with the Executive Board’s proposal for the appropriation of \\ndistributable profit. \\nDB Beteiligungs-Holding GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG, holds a 79.49% stake in DWS KGaA. As there \\nis no control and / or profit and loss-pooling agreement between these two companies, the Executive Board prepared a report on \\nthe company’s relations to affiliates (Dependency Report) for the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, in \\naccordance with Section 312 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Dependency Report was audited by KPMG, the \\nindependent auditor appointed by the company. The independent auditor did not raise any objections and issued the following \\nstatement in accordance with Section 313 of the German Stock Corpor ation Act (AktG): “According to the results of our audit \\nthere are no objections to be made pursuant to Section 313 (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) against the report of \\nthe Executive Board on relations with affiliated companies. We hereby issue the following unqualified audit certification in \\naccordance with Section 313 (3) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) on the report of the Executive Board on relations of \\nDWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, Frankfurt am Main, with affiliated companies for the financial year 2020:  \\nTo DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, Frankfurt am Main: Based on our dutiful audit and assessment, we confirm that 1) the \\nstatements actually made in the report are correct, 2) that the company’s consideration for the legal transaction s mentioned in the \\nreport was not unduly high, 3) that the measures mentioned in the report do not speak in favour of an assessment that differs \\nfrom that of the Executive Board.” The dependency report and the audit report of the auditor were made availabl e to the Audit and \\nRisk Committee and the Supervisory Board. The review did not lead to any objections. Likewise, the Supervisory Board did not \\nraise any objections against the declarations of the Executive Board concerning the relations to affiliates. \\nPersonnel Developments \\nOn November 18, 2020, the Annual General Meeting elected Mr Minoru Kimura and Mr Bernd Leukert as shareholders’ \\nrepresentative on the Supervisory Board for a term of three years. Both Mr Kimura and Mr Leukert had previously been appoint ed \\nto the Supervisory Board by the responsible court until the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. \\nMr Ozeki timely resigned from his office as shareholders’ representative on the Supervisory Board, effective on April  10, 2020. \\nWe thank Mr Ozeki for his work and for his constructive assistance to the Supervisory Board, including his contribution as \\ndelegate of the shareholders’ representatives at the Joint Committee, during his term of office.

KGaA, the company has a Joint Committee, \\nwhich consists of two members delegated by the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner  and two members delegated by \\nthe shareholders’ representatives on the Supervisory Board from their midst.  \\nFor the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner, Mr Karl von Rohr and Mr James von Moltke are delegated to the Joint \\nCommittee. Mr Karl von Rohr is also appointed as the Chairman of the Joint Committee. For the shareholders’ representatives on \\nthe Supervisory Board, two independent members, Ms Ute Wolf and Mr Minoru Kimura, are elected to the Joint Committee. Mr \\nKimura has succeeded Mr Hiroshi Ozeki, who exited the Joint Committee when he stepped down from his office as shareholders’ \\nrepresentative on the Supervisory Board on April 10, 2020. Mr Kimura joined the Joint Committee, effective on August 10, 2020 , \\nwhen he was appointed by the court as shareholders’ representative on the Supervisory Board. On November 18, 2020, the \\nGeneral Meeting’s vote confirmed Mr Kimura’s position as shareholders’ representative on the Supervisory Board.  \\nThe Joint Committee resolves in particular on the approval of certain transactions and management measures undertaken by the \\nGeneral Partner (e.g. group reorganizations and related contracts; acquisition and disposal of real estate or participations if the \\ntransaction value exceeds a certain threshold). In addition, the Joint Committee possesses a right of proposal with respect to the \\nratification of acts of management and with respect to the determination of the variable compensation of the Managing Directors \\nof the General Partner. In the past fiscal year, the Joint Committee convened four times and all members of the Joint Committee \\nhave participated in the deliberations and the proposal adopted in the meetings. Hereinafter the committee reports, pursuant to \\nSection 19 (2) of the Articles of Association of the company, to the Annual General Meeting on its work: \\nAt its first meeting of the year on January 27, 2020, the Joint Committee concurred on the proposal for the variable compensation \\nof the Managing Directors of the General Partner for the fiscal year 2019. The final determination of the variable compensation is \\nsubject to the resolution of the shareholders´ meeting. Following a comprehensive evaluation and discussion of the target \\nachievement in 2019 and the deferral structure of the compensation as well as the performance conditions for 2018 and 2019 \\nawards, the Joint Committee unanimously agreed on the proposal for the variable compensation and conveyed its proposal to the \\nshareholders’ meeting of the General Partner where it was subsequently resolved.  \\nFocus topics of the meeting on February 28, 2020 were the compensation structure and 2020 objectives for the Managing \\nDirectors of the General Partner. The committee addressed all compensation components and the corresponding reference \\nlevels, objectives, weighting as well as key measures and assessment criteria. After a detailed review and discussion, the Joint \\nCommittee unanimously agreed on the proposal for the compensation structure 2020 as well as the individual objectives 2020 \\nand conveyed its proposal to the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner. The latter resolved the proposal as presented.  \\nAt its meeting on May 25, 2020, the Joint Committee dealt with the planned organizational and leadership team changes with si x \\nglobally integrated divisions, including the establishment of a dedicated Product division, and singular responsibilities at the level \\nof the Managing Directors. \\nOn December 10, 2020, against the backdrop of new requirements set out by the German Act Implementing the Second EU \\nShareholder Rights Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der zweiten Aktionärsrechterichtlinie - ARUG II) and the latest version of the \\nGerman Corporate Governance Code as of December 16, 2019, the Joint Committee dealt with a planned enhancement of the \\nremuneration system for the Managing Directors, which will be submitted for approval (“Billigung”) at the Annual General Meeting \\nin 2021. \\nFrankfurt am Main, March 8, 2021 \\nFor the Joint Committee of DWS Group GmbH & Co.

Thanks to the adoption of more \\ntechnology, we successfully dealt with this challenge and continued a proactive dialogue with financial stakeholders via virt ual \\nmeetings, providing the updates on the group’s business strategy and financial results.   \\nInvestor Relations and senior management have participated in number of virtual industry conferences and roadshows. In \\naddition, Investor Relations participated in virtual meetings and maintained regular contact with sell-side analysts and \\nshareholders. \\nDuring these meetings, a range of topics were covered including business development, cost efficiency, financial targets, \\nstrategic alliances, regional strategies and asset management industry outlook. This year, there has been broad acknowledgment \\nof the Group’s accelerated cost initiatives, as well as its resilience in the challenging market environment. Product innovat ion, \\nparticularly around ESG products as well as the impli cations from the group’s organizational restructuring have also been a focus \\narea. \\nEach quarter, we host a conference call to present our financial results to analysts with relevant documents provided via our \\nwebsite.  \\nDWS CEO, Asoka Woehrmann, presented an update on DWS’s corporate journey to a public audience as part of Deutsche \\nBank’s Investor Deep Dive event, which was held as a virtual event in December 09, 2020 with presentation materials and a \\nreplay of the live webcast provided via our website.\\nResearch Coverage \\nAt the end of 2020, a total of 23 brokers covered DWS shares, publishing regular commentary about the company.

Such factors include the conditions in the \\nfinancial markets in Germany, in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere from which we derive a substantial portion of our \\nrevenues and in which we hold a substantial portion of our assets, the development of asset prices and market volatility, the \\nimplementation of our strategic initiatives, the reliability of our risk management policies, procedures and methods, and other \\nrisks.

We expect our proprietary research to become increasingly \\nimportant following the implementation of MiFID II.  \\nCIO View \\nThe CIO View is our house view on macroeconomic topics, financial market forecasts, outlooks for individual asset classes, \\nmodel multi asset allocations, and DWS views on market risks. As part of our fiduciary responsibility, our portfolio managers use \\nthe CIO View as a foundation for their active investment decisions and to also share our investment expertise with clients. I n \\n2018, we incorporated environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) into our quarterly CIO View publication for the first \\ntime, recognising the importance that ESG and sustainability issues have on the wider asset management industry.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOur Strategy\\n \\n\\n9\\n \\nOur Strategy \\n\\nDWS is a leading asset manager with € 793 billion in assets under management as at December 31, 2020. We are headquar-\\ntered in Germany and operate globally, serving a range of traditional and alternative investment capabilities to institutional and \\nretail clients worldwide. In 2018, we became a listed asset manager on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, enabling us to operate \\nmore autonomously than prior to our initial public offering. \\nThe asset management industry is evolving, with greater competition, continued margin pressure, and technological disruption \\namid heightened geopolitical tensions and increased market volatility. We believe our diverse range of well-performing products \\nand investment solutions give us a strong basis for growing assets and profitability regardless of the market in which we operate. \\nOur newly introduced business targets for 2024 are as follows: \\n−The global distribution reach across retail and institutional channels, as well as from strategic partnerships, can support the\\ndelivery of a net flow target of >4 percent by 2024 (as a percentage of beginning of period Assets under Management on\\naverage in the medium-term).\\n−The strong and scalable operating platform, coupled with cost efficiency initiatives, supported the reduction of our adjusted\\ncost-income ratio to 64.5 percent, which we achieved in 2020, ahead of 2021 target. We target to achieve an adjusted cost-\\nincome ratio of 60 percent by 2024.\\nWe intend to support these refined medium-term targets with the initiatives centred on the themes of Transformation, Growth, and \\nLeadership outlined below. \\nTRANFORM: Invest into transformation for further efficiency and growth \\nFurther operational efficiency \\nCost control continues to be fundamental to execute on our business strategy and ensure shareholder value creation. In 2020, we \\nmaintained a strict cost discipline, helping us to improve our adjusted cost-income ratio to 64.5% by year-end. This was achieved \\nthrough our accelerated efficiency initiatives. We focused on making our workforce more efficient through better alignment of \\ninternal capabilities such as leveraging a robust vendor management programme. We also internalized workforce to retain skill s \\nand to avoid high-cost external contractors, In addition we increased productivity through flexible working. Further saves have \\ncome through strategic vendor management, as we continuously review, re-negotiate and consolidate vendor contracts where \\npossible to ensure we are paying appropriate prices for the services we consume. In addition, we continue to review our real \\nestate portfolio in all locations to ensure we are optimizing our office footprint. In 2021, we aim to continue to review our footprint \\nin other countries, including our headquarters in Germany. We also continue investing in our business and infrastructure functions \\nto ensure that we achieve our targeted cost-income ratio of 60% by 2024. Our vision for the future is to shift away from our \\ncomplex legacy IT infrastructure platform towards a state of the art IT infrastructure that is more efficient, more scalable and more \\nappropriate for an asset management business. In 2020, we started the project to design and implement a technology platform \\nthat is owned and managed by ourselves. Through all of these efforts, we aim to build a standalone operating model that delivers \\na sustainably low adjusted cost-income ratio, while supporting commercial success and driving agility. \\nShift towards a more performance-driven culture \\nDWS intends to deploy a functional role framework in the first quarter of 2021, which has been approved by the Executive Board \\nfor implementation. This framework will change and optimise the way we work together as a company, replacing corporate titles \\nand hierarchical thinking to foster a clear performance culture. The Executive Board decided to make this change in response to \\nemployee feedback for a more simplified corporate structure and to make progress changing the culture. The framework will be \\nbased on individuals’ capabilities, and designed to empower our employees, enco urage innovation, unlock our performance \\nculture, and enable the execution of our overall strategy. We view this initiative as important to our people development as we \\nconsider our employees DWS’s most valuable asset.  \\nGROW: Focus on and invest into targeted growth \\nOur strategy will target growth in specific product lines and regions, especially Asia, and organic growth remains a top priority for \\nDWS. In 2020, we have continued to increase our focus on the targeted asset classes of Passive, Active Multi-Asset and \\nAlternatives. As part of our regional strategy optimization, we aim to focus on developing and nurturing strategic partnerships, \\nwhich have been a driver of DWS’s strong market position in Germany and in Europe. In Asia, we are continuing to work closely \\nwith our partners Nippon Life and Harvest Fund Management to explore new business opportunities in the region. Furthermore \\nwe have extended our strategic partnership with Zurich in the unit-linked retail business in Germany by 10 years until the year  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOur Strategy\\n \\n\\n[Sustainability Strategy]\\n  \\n\\n10\\n \\n2032. We also started to adopt technology more broadly to help enable our staff to generate operating platform efficiencies. We \\nplan to continue to invest in digital capabilities to accelerate our readiness to compete in a rapidly evolving industry. This includes \\ncapabilities in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and blockchain which will complement our investment process, client front \\nends as well as middle and back office processes. Our growth commitment into digitisation and technology is further underlined \\nby our ongoing strategic partnerships with Neo Strategic Holding Limited, a digital investment platform in the Middle East, Israeli-\\nheadquartered Skyline AI, which leverages proprietary AI technology to evaluate institutional-grade property investments in the \\nUS, and Arabesque AI, a UK-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) company and Arabesque S-Ray, an ESG data provider.  \\nIn 2021, we will continue this work, with a greater focus on building our international profile outside of Germany. \\nLEAD: Differentiated leadership across ESG, Passive, and high margin strategies \\nMake ESG the core of what we do \\nWe target to make sustainability a key strategic focus of both our fiduciary and corporate activities.  We expect sustainability and \\nsustainable investments to become the driving force behind successful asset management over the coming years. Demand for \\nsustainable investment products has risen significantly and we are convinced that it will continue to rise. COVID-19 has amplified \\nattention on sustainability as the pandemic’s fallout reinforces the need to build the economy on a more responsible and \\nsustainable basis. Sustainable and responsible investment solutions achieved record inflows and more resilient performance \\nduring the COVID-19 crisis in 2020.  \\nOur aim is to become a leading ESG asset manager, which requires sustainability to be embedded in everything we do. To \\nachieve our ambitions, we developed a Sustainability Strategy, which relies on 4 focus areas: making sustainability the highest \\nmanagement priority, integrating ESG in the investment process, developing market leading products, and leading and engaging \\nto promote sustainability practices.  \\nIn 2020, we made meaningful progress in order to reach these ambitions. We introduced our Group Sustainability Officer in \\nAugust 2020, which marks an important milestone in deploying a holistic approach to our sustainability strategy. Further, we \\nstrengthened the considerations of sustainability risks and opportunities by introducing smart integration of ESG criteria into the \\ninvestment process, which constitutes a further step in the direction of defining our climate strategy. In addition, we formed a new \\nESG Advisory Board, which leverages external expertise from leading corporations, academia and public institutions. We view \\nthis as an important next step to elevate our sustainability strategy to the next level as part of our ongoing efforts to embed \\nsustainability into everything we do. Another important step is our commitment to reach climate neutrality before 2050, which we \\nannounced in November 2020 (for further information please refer to Sustainability Strategy). \\nBolster investment capabilities \\nA key strategic focus is to continue delivering consistent investment outperformance across strategies which align with the needs \\nof our increasingly sophisticated clients. In light of external factors such as search for yield, the late market cycle environment, \\ndigitization, and the shift to passive, we are evolving our innovation process to match our solutions to client demand. To this end, \\nwe unified our Investment Division in 2020, which now encompasses all liquid and illiquid investment strategies. Furthermore, we \\nestablished a unified Systematic Investment Solutions function, which combines our Passive and Quant capabilities in a single \\ninvestment unit. As a next step we now aim to build a Private Debt platform which will consolidate our illiquid Fixed Income \\nbusiness lines. \\nWe also established a standalone Product Division in 2020, which operates globally with responsibility for the entire product life-\\ncycle. The Product Division will enable a more agile and innovative approach to product development while retaining a clear focus \\non client needs, product quality, time-to -market and profitability along the product life cycle. \\n [Sustainability Strategy] \\nSustainability Roadmap \\n[GRI 102-16; 102-18; 102-20; 102-31]  \\nAt DWS, we have been providing sustainable and responsible investment strategies for more than 20 years. In 2007, we already \\nbegan to integrate ESG factors in the investment process and in 2008, DWS was amongst the early signatories to the UN-backed \\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI). Embedding sustainability criteria in our DNA and putting it at its core, is not only \\naimed at helping us to future-proof our franchise but also to participate in the global growth of sustainable and responsible \\ninvesting.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOur Strategy\\n \\n\\n[Sustainability Strategy]\\n  \\n\\n11\\n \\nRoadmap to Climate Neutrality \\nGlobal warming is one of the most pervasive issues of our time, affecting biodiversity, social equality, global wealth and company \\nvalue. To address these challenges and to transform to a net zero carbon economy, we need fast and effective changes in \\npolicies and technologies as well as investment and consumer decisions. As a fiduciary of our clients’ assets, DWS has an \\nimportant duty to incorporate all material issues that may impact their investments and help them to make more responsible \\ninvestment decisions. And as a corporate citizen, we must ensure that we manage the impacts of our business activities on the \\nenvironment and society in which we operate.  \\nAt DWS, we are committed to reach climate neutrality in line with the Paris agreement and well ahead of the timeframe officially \\nset in the agreement. This will not happen overnight, but will only succeed through close and ongoing dialog and exchange wit h \\ncustomers, regulators and stakeholders. Underlining our climate neutrality commitment, in December, we joined the founding \\nsignatory group of the “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative”. This initiative sees asset managers commit to decarbonise \\ninvestment portfolios and accelerate their contribution to achieving net zero emissions and limiting climate change to 1.5°C. As \\npart of the initiative, DWS alongside all other asset manager signatories has committed to: \\n−Work in partnership with asset owner clients on decarbonisation goals, consistent with an ambition to reach net zero emission s\\nby 2050 or sooner across all assets under management;\\n−Set an interim target for the proportion of assets to be managed in line with the attainment of net zero emissions by 2050 or\\nsooner; and\\n−Review their interim target at least every five years, with a view to ratcheting up the proportion of AUM covered until 100% of\\nassets are included.\\nAccordingly, we are embarking on a comprehensive process of defining our climate strategy. First, we will develop methods for \\nmeasuring climate impact for our Active, Passive and Alternative investment areas. In the next step, we intend to formulate \\ninterim targets for specific investment areas with a focus on the next decade, which are in line with our fiduciary duties and take \\ninto account the underlying contractual relationships between our investors and ourselves. In line with our TCFD disclosure, we \\nplan to report regularly on our progress towards achieving these goals. In that context, we published a separate DWS Climate \\nReport 2020 on our homepage this year to serve as a basis document. \\nWe see three important levers available to us to drive this transition. First, we seek to work actively with our clients on \\ndecarbonisation goals for their portfolios. We will also promote investments that are compatible with or support the transition \\ntowards the goal of climate neutrality. This also includes the development of new investment solutions. Secondly, we aim to \\nanchor climate targets even more firmly in our engagement approach. We aim to increasingly encourage investee companies to \\ncommitting to net zero greenhouse (GHG) gas reduction targets. In our voting guidelines, we have already defined our \\nexpectations of companies with regard to the assessment of risks and impacts with regard to climate change. Finally, we also \\nseek to make a contribution to the joint development of methodologies together with other stakeholders and investor initiatives, \\nfor example through our cooperation with the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), the CDP, and the Climate \\nAction 100+ Initiative\\n 1. Furthermore, we are a supporter of the TCFD, a long-standing member of the Principles for Responsible \\nInvestments (PRI) and support the IFRS Foundation’s initiative to create a global set of internationally recognized sustainab ility \\nreporting standards. \\nWe have already taken the first steps along this path this year. In the first half of 2020, we introduced Smart Integration, a new \\nmore intensive review process for managing sustainability risks. Among other things, we use our proprietary ESG database to \\nassess risks arising from the consequences of climate change. \\nWe are convinced that, together with our customers, regulators and stakeholders, we can accelerate the transition to low-\\nemission and climate-sensitive technologies and business models . \\nSustainability Governance \\nIn order to set-up the right governance framework that helps us achieving our strategic priorities, we have established new \\nresponsibilities and strengthened existing responsibilities for sustainability across our organization.  \\nThe overall responsibility for sustainability lies with our CEO, but is also shared across our entire Executive Board. In 2020, we \\nhave set up a dedicated Group Sustainability Office (GSO) to orchestrate all of DWS’s sustainability efforts globally focused  on \\ndriving forward the Group’s Sustainability Strategy and accelerate the execution. In addition, we have established a new Group \\nSustainability Council (GSC). The GSC consists of senior representatives from all businesses and functions and is consulted o n \\ncross-divisional sustainability topics. The GSC is also responsible for monitoring the Sustainability Strategy’s execution progress \\n\\n1\\n  For additional information please see https://www.climateaction100.org/  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOur Strategy\\n \\n\\n[Sustainability Strategy]\\n  \\n\\n12\\n \\nand our sustainability KPIs. To provide new outside-perspectives and expertise, we have set-up a new ESG Advisory Board that \\nconsists of six highly recognized international sustainability experts from diverse disciplines who actively advise our CEO and \\nExecutive Board on the acceleration of our Sustainability Strategy. \\nIn the Investment Division, our CIO for Responsible Investments (CIO RI), supports the integration of ESG factors into the \\ninvestment process and provides framework and data for dedicated ESG strategies, operating across its Active, Passive and \\nAlternatives platforms. The CIO RI is organized across the following responsibilities: the Responsible Investment Center, ESG \\nEngine and Solutions, ESG integration for Active and our Corporate Governance Center that enables active ownership (the \\nexercise of proxy voting and corporate governance engagement) for our Passive holdings. Complementing these activities, we \\nhave ESG investment professionals supporting our ESG activities globally. These include ESG Gatekeepers in every major \\ninvestment team of the Active platform, senior ESG portfolio managers as well as our dedicated Sustainable Investments team \\nwithin the Alternatives product line (see ‘Responsibility around our fiduciary value chain –  Responsible Investing & ESG \\nProducts’). \\nIn our global Client Coverage Division, we have appointed a Global ESG Client Officer who leads the sustainable and responsible \\ninvestment efforts with our clients. This dedicated role is aimed at ensuring that sustainability remains central to our strategic \\nclient relationships and ensuring close collaboration with the Group Sustainability Office. Moreover, our Client Coverage Division \\nhas more than 25 ESG Country Representatives - organized regionally and along distribution/client channels - that drive our \\nregional sustainability efforts with our clients. \\nIn our new Product Division, we have dedicated ESG investment specialists and an ESG Advisory team providing ESG insights, \\nanalytics and tailored investment solutions. \\nSustainability KPIs \\nDuring 2020, DWS successfully embedded Sustainability KPIs in the organisation and we have provided greater transparency to \\nkey decision makers around our progress at delivering against our strategy and achieving our Sustainability goals. Through th e \\nestablishment of the Group Sustainability Office and, more recently, the Group Sustainability Council, we will be able to provid e \\nfurther clarity and increased awareness within DWS of how we are performing against our KPI ambitions going forward. \\nWe made good progress in 2020 against our KPI ambitions outlined in the table below: \\n\\n−Dedicated ESG AuM: We demonstrated strong dedicated ESG AuM growth in 2020 with a 34%  increase over 2019. This was\\nled by robust ESG Net flows and we continue to gain momentum in our ESG Passive product sales (for further information see\\n‘Responsibility around our fiduciary value chain –  Responsible Investing and ESG Products’).\\n\\n−PRI rating for Strategy & Governance: We maintained our A+ score for Strategy & Governance and saw improvements in ESG\\nintegration and proxy voting (for further information see ‘Responsibility around our fiduciary value chain –  Responsible\\nInvesting and ESG Products’).\\n\\n−Global emissions: 2020 has been an exceptional year due to COVID-19, and this has had an impact on our emissions, most\\nnotably with our staff working from home and travelling less. Consequently, our emissions levels in all categories were below\\n2019 levels. Irrespective of the impact from COVID-19, ongoing efforts are being made to ensure that we manage and reduce\\nour operational emissions over time\\n\\n−Sustainability Rating: We achieved a C in our first CDP rating, in line with both the global and European average rating for all\\nparticipating firms. CDP informed us that a C rating was a good result for a first-time responder. We will look to improve on this\\nrating going forward\\n\\n−Gender diversity: Through initiatives we pursued in 2020 we increased the percentage of females at both the first and second\\nmanagement level below the Executive Board. W e remain on track to achieve our target of 26% of positions at the first\\nmanagement level and 29% at the second management level below the Executive Board held by female executives  by the end\\nof 2021 (for further information see ‘Responsibility around our fiduciary value chain –  Diversity and Equal Opportunities’)\\n\\n−Corporate Engagements: In 2020, we had 454 engagements with 353 companies, which represented an 82% increase versus\\nthe previous year. One of the areas we prioritized in 2020 was climate change and the risks arising from it. Consequently, we\\nincreased our scrutiny on companies that face substantial climate transition risks or seriously contravene with internationally\\nrecognized ESG standards (for further information see ‘Responsibility around our fiduciary value chain –  Responsible Investing\\nand ESG Products’)\\n\\n−Proxy voting: We saw an 8% increase in the number of companies whose shareholder meetings we voted at in 2020 from the\\nprior year. The votes are based on our Proxy Voting Focus List, which includes our most relevant holdings screened for factors\\nthat include relevant ESG ratings (for further information see ‘Responsibility around our fiduciary value chain –  Responsible\\nInvesting and ESG Products’)\\n\\nThe table below summarises our 2020 results against the ambitions DWS announced in the 2019 Non-Financial Report.

Through regional organisations such as the European Sustainable Investment Forum \\n(EuroSIF), the US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (USSIF) and UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association (UKSIF), investor reporting to the Global Sustainable \\nInvestment Association (GSIA) has become a global standard for categorising ESG assets and flows. In 2020, DWS has worked towards a classification of its investment products towards \\nArticle 6, Article 8 or Article 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) for those products in scope of the regulation which we will apply going-forward \\n2  % of BoP AuM on average in the medium-term \\n3  Air & Rail \\nCompany-wide Sustainability Strategy \\n[GRI 102-2; 102-15] \\nLast year, we further evolved our heritage in sustainable investing by making sustainability a top strategic priority for the entire \\nfirm. DWS wants to become a leading ESG Asset Manager and thought leader by applying \"ESG first\"-principles as fiduciary and \\ncorporate. We want to put ESG at the core of everything. \\nThis year marked an important milestone in our long standing history of tackling climate change. Going forward, we aspire to  be \\nan accelerator for the transformation towards a net zero carbon global economy. In November, we committed to reach climate \\nneutrality well before 2050. This means that we aim to transition our operational and fiduciary activities to become climate neutral \\nin line with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C before 2050. Our membership in the \"Net Zero Asset \\nManagers Initiative” further underlines our commitment to this goal.   \\nFurthermore, we strive to shape an organization where equality, diversity and inclusion are at the heart of all activities and we will \\ndemand that our partners, investees and of course our own corporate activities are managed under the highest standards of good \\ncorporate governance and personal integrity.

In order to deliver against these ambitions, we developed a comprehensive \\nSustainability Strategy in 2019, encompassing both the fiduciary and corporate perspective affecting DWS’s entire operating \\nmodel. \\nOur Sustainability Strategy is anchored around 4 priorities: \\n−Make sustainability the highest management priority and embed ESG in corporate DNA\\n−We have set-up a strengthened our organisation for ESG and have taken further actions to fully embrace sustainability in our\\ncorporate processes\\n−Enhance ESG integration and provide top analytics for ESG assessment and reporting\\nWe have been strengthening the consideration of ESG risks and opportunities in the investment process\\n−Develop market leading products\\n−We have further built-out our global ESG product suite by encompassing ESG-versions of our most relevant funds as well as\\nby developing new generation ESG products\\n−Lead and engage to promote best sustainable practice in the market\\nWe have enhanced our engagement activities and accelerated our activities and contributions in public and private initiatives\\nto driving sustainability practices\\nDuring 2020, we have made significant progress across all 4 priorities: \\nMake sustainability the highest management priority and embed ESG in corporate DNA : In September, we set up a dedicated \\nGroup Sustainability Office (GSO) to effectively manage our sustainability related activities across the entire organization. The \\nGSO reports to the CEO in his overall responsibility for the sustainability strategy. In December, we established a new Group \\nSustainability Council (GSC) to inform, debate and unite all business areas and functions on our Sustainability Strategy and \\ninitiatives. Furthermore, in November, we launched an external ESG Advisory Board to provide advice and recommendations to \\nfurther enhance our long-term Sustainability Strategy. On the investment side, we established a new Committee for Responsible \\nInvestments (CRI) to guide the investment platform on material risks from ESG factors in June. On our corporate side, we made \\nfurther progress to reaching our gender diversity targets for our Supervisory Board, and for our executive management levels \\nbelow the Executive Board. Additionally, we formulated a dedicated Sustainability Risk Policy and completed the integration o f \\nsustainability risks in the DWS risk taxonomy. Furthermore, we implemented first steps to integrate ESG factors in the \\nmanagement of our corporate liquidity. In 2020, for the first time, DWS was rated by ESG rating agencies such as CDP (see \\nSustainability Rating result above), and based on an above sub-sector average rating included in the FTSE4Good.\\nEnhance ESG integration and provide top analytics for ESG assessment and reporting : In June, we set new standards in ESG \\nintegration. For non-ESG mutual funds in Germany, we introduced \"Smart Integration\", an approach of enhanced due diligence to \\nmanage sustainability risks. For this purpose, we use, among other things, our proprietary ESG engine to assess risks from cli-\\nmate transition and international norm violations. If we consider substantial risks in our invested companies, we subject these \\ncompanies to an enhanced review. In most cases, we work with issuers in direct dialog to drive change. As a last resort, we can \\nexclude companies that face excessive risks related to climate change or serious violations of international standards from t he \\nrespective investment universe. This process will be further rolled-out in 2021. Furthermore, we integrated water risk into our Cli-\\nmate Transition Risk Rating. On the illiquid side, our Alternatives businesses has adopted a similar approach to ESG integration \\nby screening potential investments and portfolio assets around factors related to climate change and social norms and then incor-\\nporating the result of these reviews into the Investment Committee decision-making process. In the case of our real estate busi-\\nness, we have adopted a Global Real Estate ESG House View for our global real estate assets that specifies the requirements fo r \\nintegrating ESG into each stage of the real estate investment process. The Global Real Estate ESG House View and the ap-\\nproach to ESG integration employed by the other Alternatives businesses is addressed in greater detail in the Alternatives chap-\\nter.  \\nDevelop market leading products: We launched 3 new active ESG mutual funds, of which 2 are considered next generation ESG \\nfunds: DWS Invest ESG Next Generation Infrastructure and DWS Invest Qi Global Equity. The DWS Invest ESG Next Generation \\nInfrastructure fund invests in liquid infrastructure and real estate that helps to sustainably connect and advance the world. DWS \\nInvest Qi Global Equity is providing customers with a carbon-reducing portfolio constituent. In addition, we launched 2 new ESG \\nETFs and converted 5 non-ESG funds in ESG dedicated funds.   \\n\\nLead and engage to promote best sustainable practice in the market : In our engagements with our investee companies, we \\nintensified our focus on climate action. In this context, we also supported the CDP initiative for enhanced climate related \\ndisclosure (Science Based Targets (SBT)). More than 1300 companies received our letters of engagement on our core values \\nand expectations for good corporate governance, thematic engagement on climate risk as well as after critical votes at their \\ngeneral meetings. We held more than 440 individual engagements with companies on prevailing E, S and G topics. To further \\nunderpin our commitment to climate neutrality, we became founding signatory to the “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative” that  is  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOur Strategy\\n \\n\\n[Sustainability Strategy]\\n  \\n\\n15\\n \\naimed at galvanising the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions. As part of our engagement with \\nthe World Economic Forum (WEF), the DWS Research House published a seminal Water Risk white paper. The Research House \\nfurthered this work by teaming up with WWF, the largest independent conservation organization in the world, to co-author a report \\nhighlighting the importance of underpinning investments with a clearer approach to water risk and opportunities. Both the white \\npaper and report came in light of the Global Risks Report 2021 that was published by the WEF in January 2021. Furthermore, we \\nhave sent a public comment letter to the IFRS Foundation calling for more coherent and global sustainability standards. \\nAdditionally, our CIO for Responsible Investments was appointed to Germany’s Sustainable Finance advisory council and we \\nhave been acting as Advisor to the European Commission on Energy Efficiency. A comprehensive overview of our external \\ncommitments and memberships can be found in chapter Stakeholder Management.  \\nAddressing ESG Regulatory Compliance, the \"ESG Regulatory Governance\" programme, launched in 2019, continued its work in \\n2020 by focusing on the implementation of the requirements resulting from SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\\n 2), \\nwhich is effective from March 10, 2021 . As a member of the BVI\\n3 and the EFAMA\\n4, DWS takes an active role in contributing its\\nexperience and insights in Sustainable Finance throughout the policy and legislative process.  \\nLooking ahead, in 2021, we seek to further deliver against our Sustainability Strategy encompassing all four priorities. We seek to \\nfurther embed ESG in our corporate processes, continue to enhance our ESG assessment frameworks, develop new innovative \\ninvestment solutions and intensify our engagement activities. We will be placing a particular focus on detailing our roadmap to \\nclimate neutrality.  \\n\\n2\\n Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of November  27, 2019 \\n\\n3\\n Bundesverband Investment und Asset Management e.V.  \\n\\n4\\n \\nEuropean Fund and Asset Management Association  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nInternal Management System\\n  \\n\\n16\\n \\nInternal Management System \\n\\nAt the start of 2021, DWS Group’s management refined its medium -term financial targets as part of a broader review of priorities \\nand initiatives as well as the next phase of its corporate journey since the IPO in March 2018. \\nSince then, we have prioritised the adjusted cost-income ratio (CIR) target to ensure that we are able to generate maximum \\nshareholder value regardless of the environment in which we operate. Thus, we identified the CIR target as the target with \\nhighest priority to increase efficiency within the first phase of our corporate journey.  \\nEntering the second phase, we will focus on our ambition to transform, grow and lead in order to become a leading European \\nAsset Manager with global reach. To achieve this, we will further leverage existing partnerships, target investments in high margin \\ngrowth areas and focus on product innovations as well as on strong momentum in the Passive business. Differentiated leadership \\nin ESG as well as in high margin strategies will also become key focus areas of phase two in our corporate journey. \\nAs we strongly emphasise the CIR of 60% and net flows of >4%, we also de-emphasized the dividend pay-out ratio as DWS is \\nnow entering into the second phase of its strategy - transform, grow and lead  – with a commitment to profitable growth. \\n\\n1 Depending on market circumstances and €/$ FX rate  \\n2  As % of BoP AuM and on average \\n−Adjusted cost-income ratio (CIR) is based on adjusted costs and adjusted revenues.

Moreover COVID-19 has increased the focus on ‘S’ investments and activity in the impact investing s pace.\\n\\n−Tech revolution: The rapid advancement in technology is enabling asset managers to improve the value chain, as well as\\ncreate operational efficiencies. Robo-advisor launches and a wider adoption of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and\\nbig data is expanding product choice, enabling new solutions and enhancing performance, while COVID-19 has increased\\nfocus on digital communication and distribution.\\n−Geographic wealth shift: Emerging countries, primarily in Asia, will continue to be key drivers of future industry growth,\\noffering new opportunities for asset managers as local investors expand their investment horizons globally.\\n−Investor sophistication: Investors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their investment requests, demanding higher\\nstandards in product quality, performance and service. Demand for more sophisticated pension solutions is continuing to grow,\\ndriven by the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes.\\n−Scale and diversified capabilities  are becoming increasingly important attributes for asset managers to continue growing in\\na more challenging revenue environment and amid heightened competition.

For additional information, detailed descriptions are provided within the ‘Summarized Management  \\nReport’ in the sections ‘Our Strategy’, ‘Risk Report’ and ‘Responsibility around our Fiduciary Value Chain’.  \\n\\n5\\n  ETFGI, December 2020.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOperating and Financial Review\\n  \\n\\nOverview of 2020\\n  \\n\\n19\\n \\nOur financial strength \\nIn 2020 and in light of the challenging market environment, we focused on executing and delivering our strategic priorities and we \\ndemonstrated financial resilience as well as the strength of our diversified business model during the severe economic slowdown \\nand market volatility. Looking back over the past 12 months, management focus on efficiency and cost measures has been \\nsuccessful. The adjusted cost base declined significantly year-on-year and the full-year adjusted cost-income ratio improved to \\n64.5%, beating our target of below 65% one year ahead of plan. Cost savings have also been achieved through the continuous \\nimplementation and the acceleration of efficiency initiatives. While the pandemic has also contributed to temporary cost \\nreductions, cost control continued to be fundamental to our business strategy. \\nSuccessful crisis management \\nIn light of the pandemic, DWS’s Annual General Meeting 2020 was postponed to November 18, 2020 and was held successfully \\nin a virtual format for the first time in DWS’s history. The decision enabled us to protect the health of our shareholders, e mployees \\nand service providers.  \\nThroughout the year, we saw the COVID-19 pandemic escalate globally, which led to increased challenges due to heightened \\ntransaction volumes and market volatility, alongside increasing information security threats. Involving leaders from across t he \\norganisation, the crisis management measures we introduced focussed on the health of our employees, operational effectiveness \\nand ongoing dialogue with our clients and also ensured sufficient fund liquidity to meet the needs of our clients and to identify and \\naddress potential portfolio risks as a result of the crisis. The effective management of these issues enabled DWS to respond to \\nthose challenges, protecting the interests of all stakeholders.   \\nOrganizational restructuring \\nFrom an operational perspective, we have focused on implementing organisational changes in 2020, as part of DWS’s strategic \\ninitiatives. To meet future challenges, we need to stay focussed on the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations.  \\nIn June 2020, we announced the simplification of our global structure to become more integrated, removing silos, creating greater \\naccountability, improving efficiency and client-centricity, and adopting a more consistent model across the global business. For \\nexample, DWS’s investment platform will work as one glo bal group with market-leading investment performance and expertise in \\nall regions, where DWS actively operates. By moving to one unified global distribution team, we ensure a coherent approach to \\nclient coverage, whilst reflecting regional differences. Therefore, our Coverage teams will work globally integrated but still \\nregionally aligned and more focused along client segments. In addition, we established a new product organization with \\nresponsibility for the entire product life-cycle. We also continued staff engagement and regular communication to maintain a \\npositive culture and foster teamwork across all locations. Moreover, we look back at a significant technology and operations \\nexercise to successfully provide hardware and connectivity to 100% of DWS staff across the globe enabling effective working \\nfrom home.  \\nProduct innovation \\nProduct innovation remained a fundamental topic for us to meet the requirements of our diverse client base. This year we have \\nseen growing demand for products that can generate positive performance in a low interest rate environment, leading to a \\nrenewed interest in multi-asset funds, including the launch of the DWS AL Global Dynamic Fund in the fourth quarter of 2020. \\nESG themed products also remain a key feature of our product portfolio as evidenced by the majority of new product launches \\nhaving an ESG focus in 2020 as well as DWS ESG funds attracting robust net flows in 2020  – a trend which continued from 2019. \\nESG achievements and their external recognition \\nESG has remained a crucial strategic focus across all aspects of our business, spanning the investment platform, client coverage, \\nsupporting infrastructure functions and more broadly within our company culture. We have taken bigger steps to build on our ESG \\nexperience and we can reference several ESG achievements in 2020.  \\nFurthermore, we have established new responsibilities and strengthened existing responsibilities for sustainability across ou r \\norganization in order to set-up the right governance framework that helps us achieving our strategic priorities. Thus, we set up a \\nGroup Sustainability Office (GSO) led by our newly appointed Group Sustainability Officer and a new Group Sustainability \\nCouncil (GSC), which consists of senior representatives from all businesses and functions and is consulted on cross-divisional \\nsustainability topics but also responsible for monitoring the Sustainability Strategy’s execution progress and our sustainabi lity \\nKPIs. Moreover, our Chief Investment Officer (CIO) for Responsible Investments has become a member of the German \\nGovernment\\'s Sustainable Finance Advisory Council. In November 2020, we established an ESG Advisory Board, which elevates  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOperating and Financial Review\\n  \\n\\nOverview of 2020\\n  \\n\\n20\\n \\nand further advances our holistic ESG strategy. The ESG Advisory Board provides new outside-perspectives and expertise and \\nconsists of six highly recognized international sustainability experts from diverse disciplines who will actively advise the CEO and \\nthe Executive Board on the acceleration of its ESG strategy. Further information regarding our ESG Advisory Board can be found \\nin our Corporate Governance Statement. \\nIn the beginning of 2020, we introduced DWS’s Smart Integration, an approach of enhanced due diligence to manage \\nsustainability risks. This process will be further rolled-out in 2021 and will help us to deliver a more sophisticated approach that \\nwill improve sustainability standards in asset management. \\nDWS has also been recognized externally for its strong ESG integration approach as well as sustainability reporting within \\nratings, which consider a large number of high-quality entries from around the world.  \\nDWS has also received an A+ rating for Strategy & Governance in the annual Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) \\nassessment for the third year in a row. The A+ rating, which is the highest awarded, positions DWS above the median score for \\nall PRI signatories, as well as participating investment managers. Looking ahead, we will continue to advance on our path \\ntowards sustainability. In this respect, we have made significant progress so far in 2020 despite the disruption of COVID- 19. \\n2020 marked an important milestone on our climate action path: DWS made a commitment to become climate neutral and later \\non became one of the founding signatories of the “Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative”  as one of only a few European asset \\nmanagers. This initiative sees asset managers commit to decarbonise investment portfolios and accelerate their contribution t o \\nachieving net zero emissions and limiting global warming to 1.5°C. \\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) engagement \\nWith our CSR engagement, we are committed to tackling climate change and addressing social inequalities in order to help \\novercoming two of the greatest challenges facing our society today. \\nTo mark the launch of our new Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme with broader social commitment at its core, we \\ndonated € 1 million to charitable organizations in countries around the world, where DWS is active and which have been \\nparticularly impacted by the pandemic. Donations were contributed by DWS as a firm, including private donations from DWS staff \\naround the globe. Our contribution to society and commitment to fight the fallout of the pandemic offered the chance for DWS to \\ncontribute towards the solution of a global problem while simultaneously mobilizing employees, who were called to submit \\nproposals on which aid organisations DWS could support. The majority of our € 1 million corporate donation was shared among \\ncharities that have been specifically set up to prevent hunger across India, Germany, Spain, Italy, the US and the UK. \\nAdditionally, DWS is helping to fund “The Global Health Research Accelerator”, a social enterprise launched by The Global \\nHealth Network and the University of Oxford who help set up and conduct of critical research in tackling and preventing epidemics \\nand diseases affecting impoverished communities in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Despite the difficult starting conditions \\nmanagement fees were broadly flat year-on-year. Thanks to our diversified business, we were able to achieve positive net inflows \\nof € 30 billion in the full year 2020, resulting in 4% net flows for 2020, in line with our 3 -5% target range. \\nOur management focus on efficiency and cost measures continued to pay off, with our adjusted cost base 6 declining year-on-year \\nresulting in an adjusted Cost-Income Ratio 6 of 64.5% already achieving our targeted medium-term ratio of below 65%. \\nTotal revenues were € 2,237 million, a slight decrease of € 152 million, or 6% compared to the full year 2019. Management fee s \\nwere broadly flat, as a positive market performance in 2019 and strong growth in passive and alternatives are compensating fo r \\nthe unfavourable effect from a decline in equity markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing margin compression. Net \\nperformance and transaction fees decreased significantly by € 115 million, or 56% mainly driven by non -recurring alternatives and \\nmulti-asset performance fees recognized in 2019. Other revenues were €  14 million, a significant decrease of € 34 million \\ncompared to 2019, primarily driven by the unfavourable change in fair value of guarantees for the guaranteed products. \\nOverall the adjusted profit before tax\\n6 slightly increased by 3% to € 795 million for the full year 2020 (2019: €  774 million) largely \\ndriven by a reduction in adjusted costs compensating for the reduced total revenues. \\nThe Executive Board will propose an increased dividend o f € 1.81 per share for the 2020 financial year (2019: € 1.67), in line with \\nour 65 to 75% dividend payout ratio, subject to Annual General Meeting approval on June 9, 2021. \\nAssets under Management were € 793 billion, an increase of € 25 billion compared to  December 31, 2019 marking record high \\nsince DWS’s IPO in early 2018. The increase was mainly driven by favourable net flows of € 30 billion and a positive market \\nperformance in the second half of 2020 contributing € 24 billion partially offset by unfavourable FX movements of € 26 billion.  \\nFinancial Performance \\nThe alternative performance measures (APM) in the following table are not recognised under generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples (GAAP) but are used to judge DWS Group’s historical or future perfo rmance and financial position. These include \\nassets under management (AuM) and net flows, which are important key performance indicators to evaluate revenue potential \\nand business development. In addition, non-recurring items are excluded from net revenues or total non-interest expenses in \\norder to be able to review the revenue and cost development over longer periods. Our management uses APM as supplemental \\ninformation to develop a fuller understanding of the development of our business and the ability to generate profit. These APM \\nshould not be considered in addition to net income or profit before tax as measures of our profitability. Similar APM are used by \\nour peers within the asset management industry, but these may be calculated differently and may not be comparable to the APM \\nwe use, even if the names of such APM and non-GAAP measures suggest that they are similar. \\n\\n2020\\n \\n2019\\n \\n\\nAssets under management (AuM)\\n(1)\\n \\n(in € bn)\\n \\n 793\\n \\n767\\n \\n\\nNet flows\\n(2)\\n \\n(in € bn)\\n \\n 30\\n \\n26\\n \\n\\nManagement fee margin\\n(3)\\n \\n(in basis points (bps)) \\n 28.3\\n \\n29.6\\n \\n\\nAdjusted revenues\\n(4)\\n \\n(in € m) \\n 2,237\\n \\n2,389\\n \\n\\nAdjusted costs\\n(5)\\n \\n(in € m) \\n 1,442\\n \\n1,615\\n \\n\\nCost\\n-\\nincome ratio (CIR)\\n(6)\\n \\n(in %) \\n 65.9\\n \\n69.4\\n \\n\\nAdjusted cost\\n-\\nincome ratio\\n(7)\\n \\n(in %) \\n 64.5\\n \\n67.6\\n \\n\\nAdjusted profit \\nbefore tax\\n(8)\\n \\n(in € m) \\n 795\\n \\n774\\n \\n\\n(1)Assets under management (AuM) is defined as (a) assets held on behalf of customers for investment purposes and/or\\n(b) client assets that are managed by us on a discretionary or advisory basis.

Other income (loss) includes €  30 million for 2020 (€ (141) million for the 2019) valuation adjustments on \\nliabilities of guaranteed funds. DWS Group has no stake in these funds. \\n3 Includes restructuring costs of € 15 million for 2020 (€ 29 million for 2019).  \\nIn 2020, we reported a slightly higher profit before tax of € 762 million, an increase of € 31 million, or 4% compared to pri or year. \\nOur net interest and non-interest income was lower than in 2019, with flat management fees, significantly lower performance and \\ntransaction fees and remaining revenues. Non-interest expenses were lower than in 2019. \\nTotal net interest and non-interest income was € 2,237 million, a slight decrease of € 152 million, or 6% compared to 2019. \\nPerformance and transaction fees decreased significantly by € 115 million, or 56% mainly driven by an alternatives and a multi \\nasset performance fee recognized during 2019, which did not recur in 2020. Management fees were broadly flat, with a positive \\nmarket performance in 2019 and strong growth in passive and alternatives compensating for the unfavourable effect from a \\ndecline in equity markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic and margin compression. Remaining revenues amount to €  14 million, \\na decrease of € 34 million compared to prior year, primarily driven by the unfavourable change in fair value of guarantees for the \\nguaranteed products. \\nNon-interest expenses of € 1,474 million are € 183 million or 11% lower compared to 2019. The decrease in compensation and \\nbenefits is mainly driven by lower deferred compensation and a reduction in salaries and overtime as well as restructuring \\nactivities. General and administrative expenses decreased driven by lower charges for services provided by Deutsche Bank \\nGroup, reduced marketing and travel expenses as well as reductions in buildings and leases, market data and banking services.

The increase was \\nmainly driven by the favourable net flow development of € 30 billion and a positive market performance of € 24 billion mainly  \\ncoming from the second half of 2020. This is partially compensated by  an unfavourable FX impact of € 26 billion and other \\nmovements of € 3 billion.\\nThe level of AuM is a key factor affecting the results of operations because a significant percentage of management fees is \\npredominantly charged as a proportion of AuM. Assuming management fee margins remain unchanged, an increase in the level \\nof average AuM will generally lead to an increase in revenues, mainly management fees.  \\nNet flows \\nNet flows represent assets acquired from or withdrawn by clients within a specified  period. In 2020 we generated net flows of € 30 \\nbillion mainly due to strong inflows into liquidity products and our targeted growth areas of passive and alternatives as well as \\nActive Equity, partially offset by net outflows across the remaining active asset classes. \\nFX impact \\nFX impact represents the currency movement of products denominated in local currencies against the Euro. It is calculated by \\napplying the change in FX rate to the ending period assets and is calculated on a monthly basis.\\nPerformance \\nPerformance primarily represents the underlying performance of the assets, which is driven by market effects (equity indices, \\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates) as well as fund performance. The market performance in the period led to an increase  in \\nAuM of € 24 billion particularly in our fixed income and passive products.  \\nFinancial Position \\nLiquidity \\nWe principally fund our business through equity and cash generated by our operations. To ensure that the Group can fulfil its \\npayment obligations at all times and in all currencies, we operate a liquidity risk management framework that includes stress-\\ntesting of our current and forecasted liquidity position. As part of the annual strategic planning process, we project the \\ndevelopment of the key liquidity and funding metrics based on the underlying business plans to ensure the plan is in compliance \\nwith our risk appetite. As of December 31, 2020 we held cash, bank balances, government bonds and money market funds \\ntotalling € 3,057 million (€ 3,047 million as of December 31, 2019). To further diversify our funding capabilities, we have a € 500 \\nmillion multicurrency revolving credit facility in place, under which there were no drawings as of December 31, 2020.

The increase is mainly driven by net sales of money market funds and other \\ninvestments in the amount of € 283 million and regular net cash movements of € 674 million offset by dividend payment of € 334 \\nmillion, net tax payments of € 324 million and purchase of investments in German sub -sovereign bonds of € 196 million. The \\ndecrease in financial assets at fair value through profit and loss of  € 465 million mainly relates to net sales in money market funds \\nand other investments of € 283 million, a decrease in guaranteed funds and investment contract assets of € 229 partly offset by \\nother movements of € 47 million. Goodwill and other intangible assets decreased by  € 231 million mainly driven by a negative \\nforeign exchange impact due to weaker USD. Remaining assets increased by  € 88 million mainly driven by an increase in \\nfinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income of € 196 million due to the purchase of German sub -sovereign \\nbonds, increase in equity method investments of € 28 million and a decrease in other receivables and other items of € 136 million. \\nAs of December 31, 2020, total liabilities decreased by  € 414 million (or 10%) compared to year-end 2019. The overall decrease \\nwas primarily driven by a decrease in guaranteed funds and investment contract liabilities of € 249 million , decrease of other \\npayables of € 212 million offset by an increase in negative market value from derivatives of € 48 million.   \\nEquity \\nThe total equity as of December 31, 2020 was € 6,762 million compared to € 6,852 million as of December 31, 2019. The \\ndecrease of € 90 million is mainly driven by dividend payment € 334 million, negative impact from foreign exchange rate \\nmovements on capital denominated in currencies other than the Euro of €  305 million and the net income after tax for the year \\n2020 of € 558 million.

The increase was mainly driven by profit recognition, net of the dividend payment for 2019, and \\nthe impact of two changes in the regulatory capital requirements:  \\n−The first is the change of software intangibles deduction from CET1 according to regulation (EU) 2020/2176 (CRR2). Due to\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, this rule of the CRR2, effective June 28, 2021, was brought forward to December 31, 2020. The\\nlower deduction of software intangibles led to higher RWA.\\n−The second is the move from at-cost to at-equity valuation of investments that are consolidated under IFRS but not under the\\nregulatory scope of consolidation. This change is due to article 18 (7) CRR2, which is applicable effective December 28, 2020 .\\nThe increase of the CET1 was partially offset by FX movements. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) according to CRR/CRD IV were \\n€ 10,309 million as of December 31, 2020, increased by  € 1,122 million compared with € 9,187 million at the end of 2019. The \\nincrease was largely due to guarantees provided to our retirement products. The CRR/CRD IV CET 1 capital ratio was 29.2% as \\nof December 31, 2020, compared with 30.8% at the end of 2019, as shown in the table below.

Supplementary to our Group reporting, this section \\nprovides details on the performance of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA (DWS KGaA). \\nIn contrast to the consolidated financial statements, the single entity financial statements of DWS KGaA are not prepared in \\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), but with the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the \\nsupplementary provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). \\nCorporate and Legal Structure of DWS KGaA \\nDWS KGaA is a partnership limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien  – KGaA) with a German-law limited liability \\ncompany (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung – GmbH) as its general partner. A KGaA is a hybrid legal form under German \\ncorporate law, which has elements of both a limited partnership and a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft  – AG). Like a stock \\ncorporation, the share capital of a KGaA is held by its shareholders. Like a limited partnership, the KGaA is managed by a \\ngeneral partner which is subject to unlimited liability vis-à-vis third parties.  DWS KGaA’s sole general partner, DWS Management \\nGmbH, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DB Beteiligungs-Holding GmbH, which is 100% owned by Deutsche Bank AG.  \\nDWS KGaA was publicly listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on March 23, 2018. \\nThere are domination and profit pooling agreements in place with its subsidiaries DWS Beteiligungs GmbH, DWS International \\nGmbH and DWS Real Estate GmbH. \\nOperational Activity of DWS KGaA \\nDWS KGaA was established to act as the parent company of the separated Deutsche Bank Asset Management business. The \\nbusiness purpose of the company is the holding of participations in as well as the management and support of a group of financial \\nservices providers. The company acts as a BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, the Federal Financial \\nSupervisory Authority) and Bundesbank supervised Financial Holding Company and is designated as a super-ordinated \\nundertaking of DWS Group pursuant to Section 10a (2) sentence 2 of the German Banking Act (KWG). The company itself is not \\nactive in the operating asset management business, but rather holds a large number of major shareholdings.  \\nResults of Operations of DWS KGaA \\n\\nChange from 2019\\n \\n\\nin € m.

Our \\nearnings therefore largely depend on the development of the subsidiaries.  \\nIncome from profit pooling agreements from German subsidiaries slightly decreased by  € 23 million to € 582 million in 2020, due \\nto decreased profit transferred from DWS Beteiligungs GmbH, partially offset by increased profits transferred from DWS Real \\nEstate GmbH and DWS International GmbH.  \\nIncome from participating interests amounted to € 33 million in 2020 and mainly included dividends from DWS Investments \\nSingapore Limited. In 2019, income from participating interests additionally included dividends from DWS Group Services UK \\nLimited and DWS Alternatives Global Limited.  \\nImpairment on financial assets amounted to € 21 million compared to € 107 million in the previous year and primarily related to \\nour investment in DWS Investments Japan Limited (impairment of € 20 million). This impairment was driven by adverse \\nmanagement fee developments at the local country level. \\nStaff expenses increased by € 4 million to € 20 million mainly due to a higher average number of employees. \\nOther operating expenses which mainly reflect DB Group charges including DWS Management GmbH charges were flat \\ncompared to 2019. \\nIncome tax expense of € 142 million consists of € 163 million current tax expense less a deferred tax benefit of € 22 million. \\nIncome tax expense increased by € 6 million mainly driven by decreased dividend recognitions in 2020 that are 95% tax exempt. \\nNet income increased by € 23 million to € 388 million in 2020. \\nProposed Appropriation of Profit \\nThe distributable profit amounted to € 450 million as of December 31, 2020.

The increase mainly related to the settlement of profit pooling agreements for 2019 \\nand dividends received of € 686 million, partially offset by the dividend payment for 2019 of € 334 million and net tax payments of \\n€ 163 million.  \\nEquity \\nThe capital and reserves of DWS KGaA as of December 31,  2020 were € 8,128 million, split into subscribed capital of \\n€ 200 million, reserves of € 7,478 million and a distributable profit of € 450 million. The increase by € 54 million compared to \\nDecember 31, 2019 related to the net income of the current year partially offset by the dividend paid.

Other provisions increased mainly due to higher provisions in \\nconnection with services provided by companies of the Deutsche Bank Group including DWS Management GmbH. The decrease \\nof provisions for taxes is due to tax payments of €  177 million for current and prior years partly offset by current tax expense of \\n€ 163 million.  \\nTotal liabilities were € 419 million, essentially flat compared to year-end 2019. \\nLiquidity \\nThe Capital and Liquidity Management function is mandated to manage the overall liquidity and funding position of DWS KGaA. \\nWe principally fund our business through equity and cash generated by our operations. To ensure that DWS KGaA can fulfil its \\npayment obligations at all times and in all currencies, we established a prudent liquidity planning and monitoring process.  \\nAs DWS KGaA is a holding company the upcoming cash in- and outflows can be reliably forecasted. Cash inflows are largely \\ngenerated by income from profit pooling agreements and from participating interests as well as DWS Group internal intermediat e \\nfinancing. Cash outflows mainly consist of the dividend payment to DWS shareholders, acquisitions, operational expenses and \\ntax payments for the German tax group. \\nAs part of the annual strategic planning process, we project the development of the key liquidity and funding metrics based on the \\nunderlying business plans to ensure the plan is in compliance with our risk appetite. As of December 31, 2020 we held bank \\nbalances of € 200 million (€ 33 million as of December 31, 2019) and liquid money market funds of €  11 million (€ 51 million as of \\nDecember 31, 2019). To further diversify our funding capabilities, we have a €  500 million multicurrency revolving credit facility in \\nplace, under which there were no drawings as of December 31, 2020 .  \\nRisks and Opportunities of DWS KGaA \\nThe business performance of DWS KGaA is largely subject to the same risks and opportunities as the performance of DWS \\nGroup presented in the consolidated financial statements.  \\nDWS KGaA generally participates in the risks of its shareholdings and subsidiaries in accordance with its respective percentage \\ninterest held.

Pursuant to Section 6 (1) and (2) of the Articles of Association of the General \\nPartner, the General Partner shall have at least two Managing Directors (Geschäftsführer) who are appointed and dismissed by \\nresolution of the shareholders’ meeting of DWS Management GmbH. The Managing Directors manage the business activities of \\nDWS Management GmbH and – with regard to the position of DWS Management GmbH as the General Partner of DWS KGaA  – \\nthe business activities of DWS KGaA. For ease of reference, the Managing Directors are collectively referred to as the “Executive \\nBoard”. They are also responsible for representing DWS Management GmbH as well as DWS KGaA vis -à-vis third parties. \\nDecisions taken by the Executive Board are in accordance with the law, the Articles of Association of DWS KGaA and the \\nGeneral Partner, the Terms of Reference of the Executive Board and, subject to the statutory and regulatory restrictions, \\ninstructions from the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner .

Pursuant to the Articles of Association of DWS KGaA, the \\nresolutions of the General Meeting are taken by a simple majority of votes and, in so far as a majority of capital stock is required, \\nby a simple majority of capital stock, except where law or the Articles of Association determine otherwise (Section 25 (1)). \\nResolutions passed in the General Meeting require the approval of the General Partner where they involve matters which, in the \\ncase of a limited partnership, require the authorization of the personally liable partners. This includes resolutions on the \\namendment of the Articles of Association. To the extent that the resolutions of the General Meeting are subject to the consent of \\nthe General Partner, the General Partner shall declare at the General Meeting whether consent to the resolutions will be given or \\nwill be refused (Section 25 (3)).

If the volume of shares offered in a public purchase offer exceeds t he\\nplanned buyback volume, acceptance must be in proportion to the shares offered in each case. The preferred acceptance of\\nsmall quantities of up to 100 of the company’s shares offered for purchase per shareholder may be provided for.\\nIn addition, the General Partner is authorized to dispose of the purchased shares on the stock exchange or by an offer to all \\nshareholders.

The General Partner may only use this authorization if it has been ensured that the number of \\nshares sold on the basis of this authorization does not exceed 10% of the company’s share capital at the ti me this authorization \\nbecomes effective or – if the amount is lower – at the time this authorization is exercised. Shares that are issued or sold during \\nthe validity of this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights, in direct or analogous application of Section 186 (3) \\nSentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), are to be included in the maximum limit of 10% of the share capital. \\nAlso to be included are shares that are to be issued to service option and/or conversion rights from convertible bonds, bonds with \\nwarrants, convertible participatory rights or participatory rights, if these bonds or participatory rights are issued during the validity  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nInformation pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a of the \\n\\nGerman Commercial Code and Explanatory Report\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Agreements which Take Effect, Alter or \\n\\nTerminate upon a Change of Control of the Company \\n\\nFollowing a Takeover Bid\\n  \\n\\n34\\n \\nof this authorization with the exclusion of pre-emptive rights in corresponding application of Section 186 (3) Sentence 4 of the \\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (AktG).  \\nFinally, the General Partner is also authorized to cancel shares acquired on the basis of the described authorizations or a \\npreceding authorization without the execution of this cancellation process requiring a further resolution by the General Meeting. \\nBy resolution of the Annual General Meeting of June 5, 2019 the General Partner is authorized pursuant to Section 71 (1) No.  8 \\nof the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) to execute the purchase of shares under the resolved authorization also with the use \\nof derivatives. The purchase of shares may be executed, apart from in the ways described above with the use of put and call \\noptions or forward purchase contracts. DWS KGaA may sell to third parties put options based on physical delivery and buy call \\noptions from third parties if it is ensured by the option conditions that these options are fulfilled only with shares which themselves \\nwere acquired subject to compliance with the principle of equal treatment. All share purchases based on put or call options are \\nlimited to shares in a maximum volume of 5% of the actual share capital at the time of the resolution by the General Meeting  on \\nthis authorization. The term of the options must be selected such that the share purchase upon exercising the option is carried \\nout at the latest on May 31, 2024.  \\nThe authorization provides for certain thresholds for such transactions.

DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOutlook\\n \\n\\nAsset Management Industry\\n  \\n\\n36\\n \\nThere are a number of risks to the global economic outlook. Ongoing challenges from COVID-19 and scope for further lockdowns \\nin 2021 could considerably dampen economic momentum. Growing government debt burdens could also impact the broader \\nEurozone economy. Trade tensions including upcoming trade negotiations between the US and the European Union (EU) could \\nnegatively impact the global economic outlook. Additionally, rising geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East could \\ncreate further uncertainty.  \\nAsset Management Industry \\n2020 has been an extraordinary year for the asset management industry, due to the onset of COVID-19 and the global economic \\nfallout as a result of the pandemic. Despite plunging markets in the early part of the year, the timely intervention of central banks \\nand governments saw markets recover and investor confidence largely return. For asset managers the pandemic has heightened \\na number of key trends that will continue to shape the industry, the adoption of environmental, social and governance (ESG), a \\nrenewed focus on technology and greater appetite for private market exposure. Although ESG investing has gained popularity in \\nrecent years, the pandemic has pushed it to the fore driven by investors seeking to reduce portfolio and climate change risk while \\nseeking outcomes beyond investment returns. Wider adoption of existing and new technology helped to keep asset managers \\noperational, as working from home became the norm, while investors searching for higher yields and diversification have turned \\nincreasingly to private markets, a trend expected to continue as governments rebuild economies and companies seek access to \\ncapital following the pandemic. \\nThe industry also faces a number of ongoing challenges including margin pressure, driven in part by the switch to passive \\ninvesting, and slower growth in assets under management, which forces managers to review their business models and cost \\nstructures and is likely to drive further market consolidation. Nevertheless, the long-term drivers of industry growth remain, \\nincreasing wealth in developing economies, low interest rates pushing unmanaged assets, such as cash and deposit accounts, \\ninto managed portfolios and the need for financial solutions including retirement provision. \\nDespite near-term industry and economic headwinds, DWS believes the asset management industry will continue to grow over \\nthe longer term and managers able to offer a wide-range of active, passive, public and private strategies will be able to benefit \\nfrom opportunities in the market. \\nDWS Group \\n\\nWhile we are cautiously optimistic on equity markets, we also want to insulate our business from the prospect of continued \\nvolatility and potential market challenges. So far, we have prioritised our adjusted cost-income ratio target to ensure we are able \\nto generate maximum shareholder value regardless of the environment in which we operate. \\nGoing forward, growth and efficiency will drive shareholder value creation, which is why we have refined our medium-term \\ntargets: By 2024, we target an adjusted CIR of 60% and a net flow rate\\n 7 of >4%. \\nGiven the current economic climate and the trends we have observed in 2020, we expect the revenue environment to remain \\nchallenging in 2021 amid ongoing margin pressure together with the low interest rate environment.  \\nThese effects are likely to impact the broader asset management industry, as well as DWS. Full year 2021 adjusted revenues are \\nexpected to be slightly higher compared to 2020. Moreover, we expect assets under management at the end of 2021 to be \\nslightly higher compared to the end of 2020, driven by net inflows. In 2021, we expect sustained net inflows into targeted growth \\nareas of passive and alternative investments, further enhanced by strategic alliances and product innovations, including further \\nESG offerings. Management fees are assumed to be essentially flat year-over-year.  \\nWe further expect normalized performance and transaction fees to be slightly higher in 2021. Other revenues are expected to be \\nsignificantly higher in 2021. In 2020, other revenues were negatively impacted mainly due to the unfavourable change in the fair \\nvalue of guarantees. This is not expected for 2021 to the same degree. \\nWe remain on track regarding our cost efficiency initiatives, which supported us to achieve our medium-term target of an adjusted \\nCIR <65% one year early in 2020. We further expect benefits from our cost savings initiatives in 2021, which will partly \\ncompensate for investments into growth and the platform transformation. We expect adjusted costs excluding transformation \\n\\n7\\n % of BoP AuM on average in the medium-term  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nOutlook\\n \\n\\nDWS Group\\n \\n\\n37\\n \\ncharges to be slightly higher compared to 2020. Compared to the previous year, the adjusted profit before tax for 2021 is \\nexpected to be essentially flat. \\nDespite structural pressures, AuM in the global asset management industry are expected to increase over the medium-term, \\ndriven by net flows in passive strategies, alternatives and a strong demand for ESG and thematic investing, as clients \\nincreasingly demand value-for-money, transparency and outcome oriented products. Due to our diverse range of investments and \\nsolutions, DWS Group is well-positioned to grow market share, supported by our broad distribution reach, global footprint and \\ndigital capabilities. Our diversified business model supports our net flow ambitions despite the adverse industry trends since the \\nbeginning of 2020. However, wider industry challenges such as rising costs of regulation and competitive dynamics are also likely \\nto remain. \\nIn the face of these challenges as well as the ongoing global pandemic, DWS Group intends to focus on innovative products and \\nservices where we can differentiate and best serve clients in a late cycle market environment, while also maintaining a disciplined \\ncost approach.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisks and Opportunities\\n  \\n\\nRisks\\n \\n\\n38\\n \\nRisks and Opportunities \\n[GRI 102-15] \\nWe have reflected in our outlook risks and opportunities that we believe are likely to occur for a period of one year. The following \\nsection focuses on certain future trends or events that may result in downside risk or upside potential from what we have \\nanticipated in our Outlook. \\nRisks \\nIf macro-economic and market conditions and growth prospects worsen compared to the expectation in our Outlook, this could \\nadversely affect our business, results of operations or strategic plans.  \\nThe economic disruption caused by the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a sharp slowdown in global GDP \\ngrowth, but the economy has picked up again in the second quarter of the year. Progress regarding the development of a COVID-\\n19 vaccination has been made and some countries began vaccinating their population. Markets have priced in this optimistic \\nscenario and hence it will be crucial that the expectations are fulfilled regarding the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination \\nand its rapid introduction. In case expectations will not be fulfilled, this may lead to a negative impact on global growth and global \\nfinancial markets. Despite the business continuity and crisis management policies currently in place, travel restrictions or potential \\nimpacts on personnel may disrupt our business. In addition, another potential economic slowdown could negatively impact our \\nrevenues, assets and liabilities. \\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy may affect our ability to meet our financial targets. While \\nthe long-term impact of the pandemic on our business and financial targets is not yet known, we may be materially adversely \\naffected by a protracted downturn in local, regional or global economic conditions. \\nContinued elevated levels of political uncertainties worldwide, protectionist and anti-trade policies, and the ongoing transition \\nperiod negotiations following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union could have unpredi ctable consequences \\non the economy, market volatility and investors’ confidence, which may lead to declines in business and could affect our \\nrevenues and profits as well as the execution of our strategic plans.   \\nBrexit \\nAs the Group is headquartered in Frankfurt and operates with a significant European footprint, our operating model positioned us \\nwell to continue our current business and operations despite the lack of a comprehensive Brexit deal for financial services. DWS \\nran a Brexit-preparedness project with a planning assumption of “no deal” and therefore was well prepared for the eventual \\noutcome. We continue to be able to serve the needs of our clients across Europe and service them from the most appropriate \\nlegal entity and jurisdiction. As a consequence of Brexit, our UK counterparties have lost their MiFID passport, and UK-based \\ntrading platforms, exchanges, and clearing venues have become third-country venues vis-à-vis the EU, and vice versa. To \\nmitigate this, UK-based brokers have established EU entities, or have extended the scope of existing EU entities to ensure they \\ncan continue to service their UK and EU clients, and this has entailed operational changes and repapering of certain trading \\ndocumentation. We have taken actions to ensure we can continue to trade in accordance with regulatory requirements and fulfil \\nclient obligations by actively engaging with our key counterparties, platforms and venues. This risk may adversely impact our \\nmedium-term target for net flows and adjusted cost-income ratio.  \\nEconomic Environment \\nUnfavourable market conditions, increasing volatility, as well as cautious investor and client sentiment may materially and \\nadversely affect our financial performance as well as the timely achievement of our strategic aspirations. At the beginning of \\n2020, global growth was reversed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related negative impact on economic activity. Positive \\nprospects due to the rapid introduction of the COVID-19 vaccination are already reflected in the growth figures, which may curb \\nthe economic recovery in case expectations will not be fulfilled. In addition, changes in the interest rate environment may have an \\nimpact on our Fixed Income strategies as well as on the fair value of the guarantees we have sold. These changes in the fair \\nvalue of the guarantees will be reflected in Other Revenues. These risks may adversely impact our medium-term target for net \\nflows and adjusted cost-income ratio.    DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisks and Opportunities\\n  \\n\\nOpportunities\\n  \\n\\n39\\n \\nDigitalisation \\nDigitalisation offers new competitors market entry opportunities and we expect our businesses to have an increased need for \\ninvestment in digital product and process resources to mitigate the risk of a potential loss of market share. This risk may \\nadversely impact our medium-term target for net flows.  \\nIn addition, with increasing levels of digitalisation, cyber-attacks could lead to technology failures, security breaches, unauthorized \\naccess, loss or destruction of data or unavailability of services. Any of these events could involve litigation or cause us to suffer \\nfinancial loss, disruption of our business activities, liability to our customers, government intervention or damage to our reputation. \\nCriminal proceedings \\nGuilty pleas or convictions in criminal proceedings by members of the Deutsche Bank Group (including DWS) and/or their em-\\nployees may have consequences that have adverse effects on our business, including reputational damage, monetary fines or \\npenalties, litigation expenses, and loss of licenses or our ability to operate in one or more jurisdictions or to deal with one or more \\ntypes of products. For example, because of certain of Deutsche Bank’s past criminal convictions, Deutsche Bank and its affili ates \\nhave been disqualified for ten years from relying on the general Qualified Professional Asset Manager (QPAM) exemption from \\nthe prohibited transaction rules under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act. When providing discretionary invest-\\nment management services to certain U.S. retirement plans, DWS in the U.S. has relied on this exemption. On December 29, \\n2017 the US Department of Labor (DOL) granted Deutsche Bank AG and certain asset management affiliates (now DWS), an \\nindividual QPAM exemption which expires on April 17, 2021. In response to the application for an extension of the existing ex-\\nemption, the DOL has published a proposal to grant a further three year exemption. However, loss of QPAM status could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on the results of DWS’s business and reputation in the United States.  \\nRegulation \\nThe regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in response to weaknesses in the financial sector together with the increased \\nregulatory scrutiny will impose regulatory compliance costs on us, create significant uncertainty for us and may adversely affect \\nour business plans as well as our ability to execute our strategic plans. Those changes that require us to maintain increased \\ncapital may significantly affect our business model, financial condition and results of operations as well as the competitive \\nenvironment generally. In addition, investigations which may be conducted by regulatory agencies can negatively impact our \\nfinancial performance. This risk may adversely impact our medium-term target for net flows and adjusted cost-income ratio.  \\nRegulators and central banks globally have set the goal of improving the robustness of financial benchmarks, especially interest \\nrate benchmarks. As a result, the ongoing availability of, among other benchmarks including the London Interbank Offered Rate \\n(LIBOR) and the Euro Overnight Index Average rate (EONIA and, together, IBORs) are planned to be discontinued by latest end \\n2021 – with the exact market transition expected to occur before then. These reforms are expected to cause at least some \\ninterest rate benchmarks to perform differently to the way that they do currently or to disappear, which may impact our current \\nproducts and services and those we may provide in the future. The discontinuation of these IBORs and the potential transition to \\n“risk-free-rates” (RFRs) pose a variety of risks to  us. Depending on how these matters and the related risks develop, and the \\nadequacy of the response of the industry, the market, regulators and us to them, the reform and discontinuation of IBORs and \\ntransition to RFRs could have adverse effects on our business, results of operations, capital requirements and profitability.\\nIf we are unable to implement our strategy successfully, which is also subject to the previously mentioned factors, we may be \\nunable to achieve our financial objectives, or we may incur losses or low profitability or erosion of our capital base, and our \\nfinancial condition, results of operations and share price may be materially and adversely affected. \\nAlthough we have established comprehensive risk management policies, procedures and methods, including with respect to non-\\nfinancial, market, credit, and liquidity risk, they may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all economic market \\nenvironments or against all types of risk, including risks that we fail to identify or anticipate.  \\nFor further details on risk management techniques and approaches please refer to the ‘Risk Report’.  \\nOpportunities \\nChanging market conditions and investor needs have created significant opportunities for the Group and the asset management \\nindustry. Future asset growth is expected to be driven by the rapid increase in personal wealth in developing countries, as well as \\nby pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, defined contribution plans, and insurers.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisks and Opportunities\\n  \\n\\nOverall A\\nssessment\\n \\n\\n40\\n \\nOur strategy has evolved through several major developments taking place in the asset management industry, all of which \\ncontribute, directly and indirectly, to anticipated growth rates: \\n−Demand for ESG investments is driving research, enhanced risk management and extensive product development,\\ncontributing favourably to our medium-term net flows target;\\n−Asset managers are developing new digital distribution capabilities as a way of accessing retail / direct- to-consumer channel,\\nsuch as robo-advisory, particularly among younger customers, contributing favourably to our medium-term net flows target;\\n−Strong growth in outcome-oriented products, such as multi asset, is driven by a combination of demographics (the “baby\\nboomer” generation demands increasingly sophisticated retirement solutions) and the shift from “defined benefit” to “defined\\ncontribution” pension funding, contributing favourably to our medium -term net flows target;\\n−Asset managers are playing a progressively larger role in providing capital to the economy, taking advantage of bank\\nretrenchment due to regulatory and capital constraints and diminished ability of national governments to fund infrastructure\\ninvestment, contributing favourably to our medium-term net flows target;\\n−Low interest rates are causing a shift from unmanaged assets, such as cash and deposit accounts, into managed portfolios,\\ncontributing favourably to our medium-term net flows target;\\n−Regulatory changes are stimulating demand for greater transparency and choice for the end consumer, contributing favourably\\nto our medium-term net flows target.\\nOur strategy includes the deployment of capital to achieve both organic and inorganic growth. Our medium-term business plan \\nincludes an increase in our seed and co-investments to grow our business organically while continuing to align our interests with \\nclients’. We also believe the trend of consolidation in the asset management industry will continue. We intend to deploy growth \\ncapital for mergers and acquisitions in a disciplined way by considering consolidation opportunities prevailing in the industry that \\nenhance our market position in key growth areas, and/or for distribution access. Any merger and acquisition activity, in addition to \\nmeeting strategic objectives, would envisage prioritization of shareholder value creation and be measured against financial \\ncriteria such as attractive return on investment (ROI) and earnings accretion. Depending on the particular merger and acquisition \\nopportunity pursued, its impact will contribute to our medium-term targets for net flows and adjusted cost-income ratio. \\nOverall Assessment \\nWe believe DWS is well positioned to capture market opportunities and address asset management industry challenges. As \\nillustrated above, changing market conditions and investor needs have created significant opportunities for us and the asset \\nmanagement industry, yet also require us to continuously monitor risks and run stress test scenarios.

Information which forms part of and i s \\nincorporated by reference into the financial statements of this report is marked by a bracket in the margins throughout this Risk \\nReport. \\nRisk in DWS Group \\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks as a result of our business activities; these risks include non-financial risk, market risk, credit \\nrisk, strategic risk and liquidity risk. The corporate risk profile is driven by various external and internal factors, including fiduciary \\nrisk. As an asset manager, our fiduciary obligation is paramount and requires us to put the interests of our clients first. W e \\nachieve this by risk managing the investment portfolios on behalf of our clients and by complying with regulatory requirements \\nand contractual obligations. \\nOver the past few years and in particular in 2019 and 2020, the integration of sustainability risks in our risk management \\nprocesses has been a focus area. Its importance has been highlighted, among others, by the publications of the amendments of \\nthe EU regulatory framework as well as publications and recommendations given at National Competent Authority (NCA) level \\n(such as the BaFin Guidance Notice published in December 2019). As sustainability risk management is a fundamental \\ncornerstone of ESG Integration, our risk management processes have been updated to ensure the guidance given is a central \\ncomponent of our corporate DNA.\\nIn this context, there are two core principles we embrace in our risk governance: every employee needs to manage risk and is \\nobligated to ensure that we operate in the best interest of our clients and our franchise; and we have strict segregation of duties \\nenabling us to operate a control environment that is designed to protect the franchise, our clients and shareholders. \\nRisk and Capital Overview \\nKey Risk Metrics \\nWe are required to adhere to the capital requirements applicable to CRR investment firms, as outlined in Art. 95 and 98 of EU \\nRegulation 575/2013 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). For more details please refer to ‘Operating and Financial \\nReview – Financial Positions’ within this report.  \\nAdditionally, we manage our capital so as to satisfy the levels of regulatory capital defined in EU Directive 2013/36 (CRD IV) and \\nCRR and required by the relevant authority, BaFin, to cover risk weighted assets (RWA) for credit risks and market risks, but not \\noperational risk. We also perform an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment in accordance with the requirements of CRD IV. \\nDWS is required to maintain capital in certain regulated subsidiaries across a number of jurisdictions. Some of these legal entities \\nare subject to dedicated internal capital adequacy requirements. For example, to comply with the regulatory requirements \\nassociated with operating an Intermediate Holding Company in the US, a comprehensive capital adequacy process (i.e. \\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review - CCAR) is required for, and undertaken by, DWS USA Corporation and its \\nsubsidiaries. \\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1) and RWA metrics form part of our holistic risk management across individual risk types . \\nInternal Capital Adequacy ratio (ICA), Economic Capital and Stressed Net Liquidity Position (SNLP) are DWS specific risk metrics \\nin addition to the above described regulatory metrics.

Both will apply in June 2021, 18 months after the date of entry into \\nforce. The aim of the new EU regime for investment firms is to introduce rules adapted to the risk profile and business model of \\ninvestment firms. DWS is required to disclose annually own funds and own funds requirements based on the new regime starting \\nwith full year 2021. \\nOverall Risk Assessment \\nMaterial corporate risk categories include 1) financial risks such as market risk associated with our co-investments, seed \\ninvestments, guaranteed products, credit risk, liquidity risk and strategic risk and 2) non-financial risks (NFRs) including \\nreputational risk and operational risk (with important sub-categories such as compliance risk, information security risks, \\ntechnology operations risk, transaction processing, vendor and model risk). We manage the identification, assessment and \\nmitigation of key risks through an internal governance process and the use of risk management tools and processes. We have a \\nclearly defined risk appetite and our approach to identifying and assessing the impact aims to ensure that we mitigate the impact \\nof these risks on our financial results, long-term strategic goals and reputation. Please refer to the section ‘DWS Risk Governance \\nand Framework’ for detailed information on the management of our material risks.   \\nExternal factors outside of our control can have a significant effect. The continued elevated levels of geopolitical uncertainty \\nworldwide, protectionism and increased tensions regarding trade and tariff negotiations, have unpredictable consequences on t he \\nglobal economy, markets and investor confidence. Such uncertainty may lead to declines in business levels and may affect our \\nrevenues and profits including obstructing the execution of our strategic plans. \\nWhilst we have been focused on mitigating the impact of Brexit on our business and operations, potential changes in the \\nregulatory environment may lead to increased compliance requirements and additional operating costs for us. Other risks that \\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position, particularly in the short to medium term, include \\n(i) increased uncertainty and volatility in UK and EU financial, real estate and infrastructure markets; (ii) fluctuations in exchange\\nrates between sterling, euro and other currencies; (iii) increased illiquidity of investments located or listed within the UK or the EU;\\n(iv) the willingness of financial counterparties to enter into transactions, or the price at which they are prepared to transact.\\nIn addition to these geo-political risks, 2020 saw the COVID-19 pandemic escalate globally and lead to increased challenges due \\nto higher transaction volumes, market volatility, and increasing information security threats. We invoked crisis management \\nmeasures involving senior leaders from across the organisation, and focused on all aspects of our business, ranging from fund \\nliquidity and identifying potential portfolio risks as a result of the crisis, through to ensuring the ongoing stability of our operations \\nand technology platform as well as protecting our staff. At the height of the crisis, the vast majority of our staff globally were \\nworking from home utilising secure remote access allowing us to seamlessly continue to service our clients’ interests. As suc h, \\nthe business proved to be resilient and the key drivers for our risk profile have not changed in terms of themes and inherent risk \\nexposure. All our portfolios, except one, were able to facilitate client redemptions, where some investors sought to reposition their \\nportfolio(s) towards safety. The exception related to an open-ended fund holding illiquid assets which introduced measures to \\nmanage the redemption flow. \\nThe assessment of the potential impacts of these risks is integrated into our stress test which assesses our ability to absorb these \\nevents should they occur. The results of these calculations show that the currently available capital, in combination with available \\nmitigation measures, would allow us to absorb the impact of these risks if they were to materialize in line with the stress test \\nparameters.  \\nRisk Profile \\nThe main risk driver of our business is non-financial risk. We are, however, exposed to other forms of risk given the impact that \\nthe market, flows and foreign exchange rates exert on our corporate activities. Of particular note in 2020 was the guarantee \\nshortfall which is particularly sensitive to movements in long-term interest rates. Consequently, the reduction in long term rates \\nduring the year 2020 resulted in a €  48 million increase in the shortfall provision from €  108 million as of December 31, 2019 to \\n€ 156 million as of December 31, 2020.

We actively take risks in \\nconnection with our business and as such the following principles underpin our risk management framework: \\n−Risk is taken within a defined risk appetite;\\n−Every risk taken needs to be approved within the risk management framework;\\n−Risk taken needs to be adequately priced; and\\n−Risk should be continuously monitored and managed.\\nRisk and capital are managed via a framework of principles, organizational structures and measurement and monitoring \\nprocesses that are closely aligned with our business activities.  \\n−Core risk management is the responsibility of the Executive Board which delegates to senior risk managers and the Risk and\\nControl Committee (and its delegates) for execution and oversight.\\n−We operate a distinct risk management model. The business and service providing areas are the \"owners\" of the risks, hence\\nthey retain ultimate accountability for all risks. Oversight responsibility, including risk control, challenge and advice, is with the\\nindependent risk and control functions. Internal Audit provides independent assurance on the control environment and its\\neffectiveness. This approach is underpinned by clear segregation of duties across the organisation reinforcing a sound contro l\\nenvironment:\\n−The DWS Group risk appetite and the risk strategy are approved annually by the Executive Board. In addition, Deutsche Bank\\nGroup sets the risk appetite for its Asset Management division, primarily DWS Group, and we are required to comply.\\n−The Strategic Capital Plan (jointly carried out by Risk and Capital and Liquidity Management) provides the basis for aligning\\nrisk, capital and performance targets for regular risk capital profile monitoring.\\n−Cross-risk analysis reviews are conducted by Risk across the firm to validate the existence of appropriate risk management\\npractices and an awareness of risk.\\n−All material risk in non-financial risk, market risk, credit risk, strategic risk and liquidity risk, are managed via dedicated risk\\nmanagement processes. Modelling and measurement approaches for quantifying risk and capital demand are implemented\\nacross the material risk types. Furthermore, we have set up a dedicated reputational risk governance framework including a\\ncommittee to assess and manage reputational risk matters. Sustainability risk is not considered to be one individual risk type,\\nbut sustainability factors are considered to be risk drivers of existing risk types being managed.\\n−Monitoring, stress testing tools and escalation processes are in place for key capital and liquidity thresholds and metrics.\\n−Systems, processes and policies are critical components of our risk management capability to facilitate a comprehensive view\\nand articulate the underlying roles and responsibilities.\\nIntegrating Climate Risk into our existing Risk Management Framework \\nAt DWS, our overall risk management and control framework provides us with complete oversight of the various risk types within \\nour organization spanning three main risk types: non-financial risks (operational risks and reputational risks), financial risks as \\nwell as investment risks, to which investors of products manufactured and managed by DWS are exposed to. \\nIn addition recent regulatory developments, especially since the outbreak of COVID-19, clearly highlight the necessity to integrate \\nclimate risk into business practices. At DWS, we already understand that sustainability factors  – including climate risk factors – \\ncan materialize and impact all three groups of the risk types mentioned above. Therefore we currently integrate sustainabilit y \\nfactors into our existing risk measurement and management frameworks enabling us to consider climate change matters within \\nour corporate as well as portfolio risks assessments.  \\n−Sustainability Risk Ratings on fund level: leveraging ESG / Sustainability issuer ratings from well-known data providers and the\\nDWS ESG Engine, we are enhancing processes to assess the diverse effects of ESG matters to determine and monitor the\\noverall sustainability risk profile of the portfolios we are managing. By identifying climate change laggards across our portfolios,\\nwe assess whether or not the resulting risks are appropriate with respect to the pre-defined risk profiles of the funds.\\n−Physical climate or transition stress tests are scenario analyses with the aim to assess the exposure or sensitivity of an\\nindividual portfolio or also the entire organization towards physical climate or climate transition factors. We are actively working\\non integrating physical and/or climate transition scenarios into our investment risk management process. In parallel, we are\\nevaluating climate transition sensitivity of the overall product portfolio and assessing which of the products investment policies\\nmight be adversely impacted by climate transition risks in the mid- or long-term.

It has formed an Audit and Risk Committee to deal with risk related\\nmatters.\\n−At the meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board reports on key risks, on risk\\nstrategy, mitigation strategies and on matters of importance due to the risks they entail. The Audit and Risk Committee\\ndeliberates with the Executive Board on issues of the aggregate risk profile and the risk strategy, and supports the Supervisory\\nBoard in monitoring the implementation of the strategy.\\n−The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Group in accordance with the law, regulations, the Articles of Associatio n\\nand it’s Terms of Reference with the objective of creating sustainable value in the interest of the Group, thus  taking into\\nconsideration the interests of the shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Furthermore the Executive Board is\\nresponsible for establishing a proper business organization, encompassing appropriate and effective risk management and\\napproves the Strategic Plan and the Risk Appetite Statement.\\nRisk Management Governance Structure of DWS Group \\n\\nThe following functional committees are central to the management of risk: \\n−The Risk and Control Committee (RCC) is the key committee dealing with review of and decision on material risk topics. The\\nRCC has various duties and delegated authority, including:\\n−Approval of key risk management principles or recommendation thereof to the Executive Board;\\n−Recommendation of overarching risk appetite parameter s;\\n−Setting of risk limits for risk resources available to the business;\\n−Supporting the Executive Board during Risk and Capital planning processes;\\n−Overseeing the resolution of Audit points;\\n−Receiving regular updates from key control functions such as Risk, Legal, Compliance, Anti Financial Crime (AFC), Finance\\nand Capital and Liquidity Management; and\\n−Overseeing and managing all control function related risks via an integrated approach.\\n\\n−The Risk and Control Committee is supported by the Capital Investment Committee (CIC), which is responsible for overseeing\\nall aspects of risk associated with portfolios of co-investments and seed capital investments.\\n\\n−The Reputational Risk Committee (RRC), is responsible for the oversight, governance and coordination of reputational risk\\nmanagement.\\n DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nDWS Risk Governance and Framework\\n  \\n\\n45\\n \\n−The Strategic Investment Committee (SIC) is the key committee responsible for corporate investment decisions and principal\\ncorporate transactions (acquisition, disposals and joint ventures). In addition, the SIC evaluates strategic investment decisions\\nand monitors progress and performance of approved transactions.\\nThe One Voice Committee supports the Executive Board in ensuring compliance with all disclosure obligations regarding\\nmaterial, in particular inside information subject to potential ad-hoc notification, or forward looking information, and ensures\\nconsistency of the communication of material or forward looking information by the Company and its representatives relating t o\\nDWS Group.\\n\\n−The Compensation Committee (DCC) develops and designs sustainable compensation frameworks and operating principles\\nand prepares recommendations on total compensation levels. It ensures appropriate compensation and benefits governance\\nand oversight for the Group.\\n\\n−The DCC has delegated authority to the Compensation Operating Committee to review and approve proposals for\\ncompensation plans as well as for equity and fund based, not pension scheme related benefit plans, pursuant to DWS\\nGroup policies. The Operating Committee ensures regulatory compliance, reviews the technical validity and operation of the\\ncompensation plans, reviews the current and future liabilities related to compensation plans and monitors risk reporting\\npackages with respect to hedge ratios, stress test limits and forfeiture expectations. It makes recommendations to the RCC\\nin respect of any hedging required in respect of compensation plans.\\n\\n−The Integrity Review Committee as delegated committee of the DCC is responsible for the review and decision of\\nsuspension and forfeiture matters involving DWS deferred awards. It enhances oversight and governance of employee\\nconduct incidents including breaches of the control environment and/or policies and procedures.\\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO) holds Group-wide responsibility for the management of non-financial, financial and fiduciary risks as \\nwell as for the comprehensive control of risk, and ongoing development of methods for risk measurement. In addition, the CRO is \\nresponsible for monitoring, analysing and reporting risk on a comprehensive basis. The CRO has direct management \\nresponsibility for various risk management functions which are established with the mandate to: \\n−Foster consistency with the risk appetite within a framework established by the Executive Board, applied to the business and\\nmonitored by the RCC;\\n−Establish and approve risk limits within the delegated authority by the Executive Board;\\n−Develop and implement appropriate risk and capital management policies, procedures and methods including infrastructure\\nand systems;\\n−Facilitate ad hoc reviews including deep dives to keep the non-financial, financial and fiduciary risk exposure within acceptable\\nparameters;\\nWe manage our risk and capital via a framework of principles, organizational structures and measurement and monitoring \\nprocesses that are closely aligned with the underlying business activities and associated risk profile. In order to achieve this, the \\nGroup leverages DB Group for defined risk services across a number of risk types, notably in terms of risk principles and \\ngovernance frameworks, capital models including stress testing as well as support on capital adequacy requirements, and in non-\\nfinancial risks specifically where specialist skills are required, such as cyber risk. \\nThe relationship with DB Group has been formalized notably via a Relationship Agreement and a Master Service Agreement. The \\nalignment is based on the following overarching principles: \\n−DWS risk committees are independent from DB Group;\\n−We must adhere to existing DB Group policies, unless otherwise agreed (comply or explain);\\n−We leverage DB Group for specific services based on cost efficiency criteria and expertise; and\\n−All such services are provided on an arm’s length basis.\\nThe Group control model has been designed to balance the need for alignment with our business, while maintaining \\nindependence and strong relationships with DB Group key control functions. \\nRisk Appetite and Capacity \\nRisk appetite expresses the aggregate level of risk that we are willing to assume within our risk capacity in order to achieve our \\nbusiness objectives. This is defined by a set of minimum quantitative metrics and qualitative statements. Risk capacity is defined \\nas the maximum level of risk we can assume given our capital and liquidity base, risk management and control capabilities, our \\nregulatory constraints and our obligations to stakeholders.   DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nDWS Risk Governance and Framework\\n  \\n\\n46\\n \\nRisk appetite is an integral element in our business planning processes via our risk plan and strategy, designed to promote t he \\nappropriate alignment of risk, capital and performance targets, while at the same time considering risk capacity constraints from \\nboth non-financial and financial risks.  \\nThe Executive Board reviews and approves the risk appetite on an annual basis, or more frequently in the event of unexpected \\nchanges to the risk environment, with the aim of ensuring consistency with our strategy, business, regulatory environment and \\nstakeholders’ requirements.  \\nIn order to determine risk appetite, we set different group level triggers and thresholds on a forward looking basis and define the \\nescalation requirements for further action. We assign risk metrics that are sensitive to the material risks to which we are exposed \\nand which are able to function as key indicators of financial health. In addition to that, we link our risk management governance \\nframework with the risk appetite framework.  \\nReports relating to the risk profile, as compared to risk appetite and strategy are presented regularly to the RCC, the Executive \\nBoard and the Audit and Risk Committee. In the event that our desired risk appetite is breached, a predefined escalation \\ngovernance matrix is applied so these breaches are highlighted to the respective committees. Changes to the risk appetite mus t \\nbe approved by the Executive Board.  \\nRisk and Capital Plan \\nWe conduct an annual integrated strategic planning process which articulates the development of our future strategic direction for \\nthe business. The strategic planning process is designed to deliver a holistic perspective on capital, liquidity and risk under risk-\\nreturn considerations. This process translates our long term strategic targets into measurable short- to medium-term financial \\ntargets and enables intra-year performance monitoring and management. Risk-specific portfolio strategies complement this \\nframework and allow for an in-depth implementation of the risk strategy at portfolio level, addressing risk specifics including risk \\nconcentrations. \\nStress Testing \\nStress testing is performed on a regular basis in order to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn or other shocks on \\nour capital profile and financial position. This exercise complements traditional risk measures and leverages DB Group’s stre ss \\ntesting process with enhancements tailored to our risk profile. All material risk types  – which consume capital - are included in the \\nstress testing exercise. The time-horizon of internal stress tests is generally one year and can be extended to multi-year, if \\nrequired by the scenario assumptions.  \\nRisk Measurement and Monitoring \\nThe appropriate measurement of all risks is a crucial prerequisite for robust risk management. All risks are measured \\nquantitatively or qualitatively, using advanced and approved methodologies. All measurement approaches must be appropriate \\nfor the type and materiality of risk measured and provide sufficient transparency including correlation.  \\nQuantitative analysis allows the measurement of the potential impact (size and likelihood) and is complemented by best-practice \\nqualitative measures to ensure comprehensive coverage of all risks on a risk-based approach. All material risks in non-financial, \\nmarket, credit and strategic, are managed via dedicated risk management processes. Modelling and measurement approaches \\nfor quantifying risk and capital demand are implemented across the material risk types. Reputational risk is implicitly covered in \\nour economic capital framework, primarily within operational and strategic risk. \\nEstablished teams within Finance, Capital and Liquidity Management and Risk assume responsibility for measurement, analysis \\nand reporting of risk while promoting appropriate quality and integrity of risk-related data. \\nWe monitor all risk taken against risk appetite and in consideration of risk and reward at the Group level, underlying risk type and \\nat portfolio level.  \\nThe monthly Risk and Capital Profile (RCP) is used to report the risk profile and is presented to the RCC and subsequently us ed \\nas the base for regular reporting to the Executive Board and the Audit and Risk Committee. The RCP is complemented by other \\nstandard and ad-hoc management reports by Risk, Finance and Capital and Liquidity Management, which are presented to the \\nRCC and/or its sub-committees where appropriate.   DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nNon\\n-\\nFinancial Risk\\n  \\n\\n47\\n \\nWe use a variety of data sources to support internal and external reporting. The risk infrastructure considers reporting at relevant \\nlegal entity and business levels and provides the basis for reporting on risk positions, capital adequacy and limit utilization to the \\nrelevant functions on a regular and ad-hoc basis. \\nModel Risk \\nModel Risk Management (MoRM) is a core component of our Risk Management Framework. We rely on models for investment, \\nportfolio management, risk management, valuation, capital planning and other purposes. The MoRM framework is in place to \\nsafeguard the interests of our clients and stakeholders as well as to fulfil regulatory requirements with respect to model risk.  \\nModels used by the firm and covered by the Model Risk Framework include models use for both fiduciary and non-fiduciary \\npurposes and may either be internally developed or sourced via third party vendor. These models generally fall into the following \\ncategories: \\n−Pricing models are used to generate asset and liability fair value measurements reported in official books and records and/or\\nrisk sensitivities;\\n−Risk and Capital models are used to evaluate the risk exposures used for regulatory or internal capital adequacy requirements ;\\nand\\n−Other models include those within DWS business lines that do not fall into the above categories, such as fund level valuation /\\npricing related models, trading / investment related models, risk management models and asset allocation models.\\nModel risk appetite is aligned to the Group’ s qualitative statements, ensuring that model risk management is embedded in a \\nstrong risk culture and that risks are mitigated as appropriate. \\nModel Risk Governance \\nModel Risk Governance has the following objectives: \\n−Maintain a robust model risk management and governance framework, including senior forums for monitoring and escalation\\nof model risk related topics;\\n−Maintain model risk policies and key operating procedures with clear roles and responsibilities for key stakeholders across t he\\nmodel risk life cycle;\\n−Assess and monitor the model control environment;\\n−Maintain the DWS model inventory to a high degree of integrity;\\n−Support ongoing model risk assessments;\\n−Perform independent model validations providing effective review and challenge to the model development and the\\nappropriateness of model use;\\n−Ensure the model risk framework aligns to industry best practice and regulatory expectations.\\nThere is interaction with DB Group in the provision of model development support and advisory services for the current suite of \\nrisk and capital models used within the Group including changes related to new regulations and/or changes in business strateg y. \\nNon-Financial Risk \\nNon-financial risk is comprised of Operational Risk and Reputational Risk. \\nOperational Risk means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from \\nexternal events, including legal risk. Operational risk excludes business and reputational risk.  \\nReputational Risk means the risk of possible damage to the DWS brand and reputation, and the associated risk to earnings, \\ncapital or liquidity, arising from any association, action or inaction which could be perceived by stakeholders to be inappropriate or \\nunethical or inconsistent with our Code of Conduct. \\nKey Drivers for Non-Financial Risk \\nNon-financial risk is inherent to our business activities. We have embedded effective internal risk governance processes and the \\nuse of risk management tools and concepts. Our integrated approach enables sound identification, evaluation, remediation and \\nmonitoring (risk management lifecycle) of the key non-financial risks like compliance, legal, fiduciary, system, processing and \\nexternal influences risk. Any failures related to the key non-financial risks could lead to material financial, regulatory or \\nreputational impacts.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nNon\\n-\\nFinancial Risk\\n  \\n\\n48\\n \\nThe most material non-financial risks in light of our business profile are: \\n−Duties to Customers: As an asset manager, we face the risk that products and services are not suitable or inappropriate for\\nthe investor or that a product that we manufacture or distribute is inappropriate. Duties to customers primarily reflect the\\nfiduciary nature of our business and the liabilities derived in case of failure to adhere to specific conditions, contractual\\nagreements or regulatory requirements.\\n\\n−Information Security: We face the risk that our business is not sufficiently protected against information security failures, i.e.\\ncyber security attacks. Our operational systems are subject to an increasing exposure to cyber attacks and other internet\\ncrime, which may compromise our ability to conduct business and service our clients in a resilient way.\\n\\n−Technology: We face the risk of loss events due to instability, malfunction or outage of our IT infrastructure. Such losses\\ncould materially affect our ability to conduct business and service our clients in a resilient way. IT related errors may also result\\nin the mishandling of confidential information and damage to our IT systems.\\n−Service Providers: We utilize a variety of service providers to support our business, systems and processes. By this we are\\nable to focus on our core competencies and to seek improvements in effectiveness, efficiency and costs. Typically, the usage\\nof service providers expose us to comparable non-financial risks inherent in delivered as if we perform the business activities\\nourselves. We remain ultimately responsible for the services our vendors provide. In addition, the usage of service providers\\nexpose us to vendor specific risks like non-adherence to contractual obligations or failure of the service provider.\\n−Transaction Processing: Our business is highly dependent on the ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily\\nbasis, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. If any of these processes or systems do not operate\\nproperly, or are subject to intentional or unintentional human error, this may result in financial losses, reputational damage,\\ncustomer dissatisfaction or potential regulatory or litigation exposure.\\nManagement of Non-Financial Risk \\nThe governance of non-financial risks follows the three lines of defence (“3LoD”) approach with the aim of protecting the Group, \\nour clients and shareholders against risk of material financial, regulatory or reputational damages. It seeks to ensure that all our \\nkey non-financial risks are identified and addressed, that accountabilities regarding the management of non-financial risks are \\nclearly assigned and risks are consciously taken on and managed in the best and long term interest of our franchise and our \\nclients and stakeholders. The 3LoD approach and its underlying governance standards apply to all levels of the organization. \\nNon-financial Risk 1st LoD Governance Standard:  As risk owners the 1st LoD businesses are fully accountable for the \\nidentification, assessment, and management of non-financial risks that originate in their organization or that their organization is \\nexposed to, and for managing them against a defined risk appetite. Risk owners are those roles in the Group that generate risks, \\nwhether financial or non-financial. The heads of the business areas must determine the appropriate organizational structure to \\nidentify their organization’s non-financial risk profile, implement a risk management and control approach within their organization, \\ntake business decisions on the mitigation or acceptance of non-financial risks within the risk appetite and establish and maintain \\nrisk owner (i.e. Level 1) controls. For the 1st LoD a dedicated Control Office is established, which focuses on a consolidated risk \\nprofile and acts as primary contact for non-financial risk management matters. \\nNon-financial Risk 2nd LoD Governance Standard : As risk type controllers, the 2nd LoD control functions qualitatively  and \\nquantitatively define risk appetite for the specific non- financial risk type they control and monitor and report on the risk type’s \\nprofile against risk appetite. As experts for their risk type, they advise  – as independent function - the 1st LoD how to identify, \\nassess and manage this risk and how to implement the risk type framework. The 2 nd LoD control functions have a veto authority \\nfor risk decisions to prevent risk appetite breaches.  \\nRisk as a 2nd LoD control function for all non-financial risks establishes and maintains the Operational Risk Framework (ORMF), \\nmonitors and challenges – as independent 2nd LoD - its implementation, and monitors overall risk levels against Risk Appetite. \\nThe third line of defence is the internal audit function which is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on \\nthe effectiveness of how the business divisions and the 2nd LoD control functions interact with respect to non-financial risk \\nmanagement.  \\nIn addition, Risk is accountable for the design, implementation and maintenance of the approach to determine a sufficient level of \\ncapital demand for operational risk for recommendation to the Executive Board. To fulfil this requirement, Risk is accountable for \\nthe calculation and allocation of operational risk capital demand and expected loss planning. It is also accountable for the \\nfacilitation of the annual operational risk capital planning and monthly review process.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nFinancial Risk\\n  \\n\\n49\\n \\nTo manage our Non-financial Risks, the ORMF defines interrelated concepts and processes aligned to the DB Group framework. \\nThe ORMF has been designed to provide a comprehensive approach for managing the key non-financial risks across the risk \\nmanagement lifecycle. The approach enables us to determine our non-financial risk profile in comparison to our risk appetite, to \\nsystematically identify non-financial risk themes and concentrations, and to define risk mitigating measures and priorities. Our \\napproach to the identification and impact assessment aims to ensure that we mitigate the impact of these risks on our financial \\nresults, long-term strategic goals and our reputation. Key concepts and processes for managing our non-financial risks are loss \\ndata collection, lessons learned and risk and control assessments.  \\nThe most material risks we seek to remediate qualify as our top risks and are regularly analysed and reported. Top risks are rated \\nin terms of both the likelihood of their occurrence and the potential impact on the Group. The concept provides a forward-looking \\nperspective on the impact of planned remediation and control enhancements. It also contains emerging risks and themes that \\nhave the potential to evolve into top risks in the future. \\nDedicated Product Lifecycle Process \\nWe have embedded a Product Lifecycle Management Framework to ensure that appropriate governance, processes and controls \\nfor the design, approval, marketing and ongoing management of products throughout their lifecycle are in place. This framewor k \\nis designed to manage the risks associated with the implementation and change of products and services, to ensure they remain \\nfit for purpose and consistent with the needs, characteristics and objectives of their intended market(s) throughout their lifespan. \\nWe apply the framework consistently across all businesses and region s. \\nDedicated Reputational Risk Management Process \\nWe seek to ensure that reputational risk is in line with our business strategy and overall risk profile. Reputational risk cannot be \\nprecluded, and is also driven by any unforeseeable change in the perception of practices by our various stakeholders (e.g. public, \\nclients, shareholders and regulators). In line with our fiduciary responsibilities, we strive to balance reputational risk against the \\neconomic interest of our clients and the firm. We seek to avoid unnecessary reputational risks that exceed risk appetite such as \\nviolations of laws and regulations including sanctions and embargoes. A dedicated DWS Reputational Risk Key Operating \\nDocument sets out the process, including roles and responsibilities, to assist our employees in identifying, assessing and \\nmanaging reputational risk. \\nFinancial Risk \\nMarket Risk \\nMarket risk in general is defined as the potential for change in the market value of financial instruments due to changes in market \\nprices. We are exposed to non-traded market risk. Non-traded market risk arises from market movements in our investments and \\nfrom off-balance sheet items and primarily impacts the main investment risk types such as co-investments, seed capital, \\nguaranteed products, structural foreign exchange and pension and other equity compensation risks. The key drivers of our \\nmarket risk exposure include movements in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, commodity prices and equity prices. \\nOur market risk exposure can also be impacted by more general market movements related to the economic environment and/or \\nsocio/political events; as outlined below.  \\nThe primary objective in the management of our market risk is to ensure that our risk exposure is within the approved appetit e \\ncommensurate with its defined strategy. \\nRisk Identification \\nBy definition, market risk is identified as the capital at risk deployed by the Group via, for example, co-investments or seed capital \\ninto funds, and/or where a financial claim against us is inherent in the product (such as Guaranteed Products). \\nSeed Investments: Seed capital is deployed to build marketable track records by providing initial liquidity for new products \\ninitiated by us. We execute an economic risk position offset program to minimize the profit/loss volatility of the seed investment \\nportfolio. Seed investments are typically short term (up to 3 years, frequently shorter) and risk positions are broadly offset within a \\n6% tracking error on notional to minimize market risk.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nFinancial Risk\\n  \\n\\n50\\n \\nCo-Investments: We have direct co-investments primarily in funds that invest in a variety of alternative asset classes such as \\nreal estate, infrastructure, private equity, and sustainable investments. Investments are made to ensure an alignment of interest \\nbetween fund investors and the Group and are normally held to maturity.  \\nStrategic Investments: Strategic investments typically have the primary objective of enhancing the franchise value by providing \\naccess, for example, to specific markets, products or exchanges. A strategic investment, therefore, has a broader strategic \\nbusiness objective than making a return on the investment itself.  \\nGuaranteed Products: We manage guaranteed retirement accounts (“Riester Products”) and guaranteed funds, whereby we \\nprovide a full or partial notional guarantee at maturity. Riester guaranteed retirement accounts are voluntary private pension \\nschemes in Germany that are government subsidized. \\nThe guaranteed products portfolios are managed using constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategies and techniques, \\nwhich use a rule based exposure allocation mechanism into highly rated assets and riskier assets, depending on market levels. \\nAn allocation mechanism between the two components limits the downside risk. Guaranteed products may invest into a wide \\nrange of equity and fixed income securities as well as other instruments permitted in the product documentation. \\nThe risk for the Group as guarantor occurs if the net asset value (NAV) at the respective guarantee date is less than the \\nguaranteed amount. This risk is regularly monitored under different stress scenarios and client contribution and cancellation \\nsimulations. Management is regularly updated on our exposure to these products. \\nPension & Equity Compensation Risk:  We are exposed to market risk from a number of defined benefit pension schemes for \\npast and current employees. The ability of the pension schemes to meet the projected pension payments is maintained through \\ninvestments and ongoing plan contributions. Market risk can materialize due to a potential decline in the market value of the \\nassets or an increase in the liability of each of the pension plans.  \\nStructural Foreign Exchange: Structural foreign exchange (FX) risk arises from our non-EUR denominated subsidiaries, \\nprimarily USD and GBP based. We monitor our structural foreign exchange risks on an ongoing basis and may selectively offset \\nthe risk positions with the primary objective to stabilize consolidated capital and internal capital adequacy ratios. \\nForeign Exchange: Investments - and related derivatives (in the balance sheet referenced as free standing derivatives)  – can be \\ndenominated in currencies other than DWS Group’s functional currency of EUR. These are translated at the period end closing \\nrate and can give rise to fluctuations (up and down) in the reported value of the investments. Foreign exchange gains and losses \\nresulting from the translation and settlement of these items are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as net gains \\n(losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. \\nRisk Measurement \\nRisk is measured by estimating the potential losses from a particular risk type. This is usually done by determining the exposure, \\nthe potential change in market value and the covariance with other relevant assets and liabilities. For example, co-investment \\nexposure is measured at cost, reflecting the cash cost of the investment when launched or acquired by us, and at current carr y \\nvalue, the fair value of the investment as reflected in our books and records. The extent to which carry value exceeds cost (or \\nvice versa) is an indication of the relative performance of the investment.  \\nIt is often the case that co-investments – into funds in particular - are not fully cash drawn at inception; rather commitments are \\nmade which are subsequently drawn over the investment period of the related fund. During this period, the unfunded elements o f \\nthe commitments are also tracked to ensure the full potential risk to the firm is monitored. \\nEstablished capital models, specific to us are used to calculate the capital consumption of the co-investment portfolio. \\nRisk Mitigation \\nWhen necessary, approvals are granted subject to conditions to mitigate the potential risk to the Group and its stakeholders. \\nSuch conditions can include limiting concentrations in high risk sectors and/or geographies. \\nOne area where risk position offsetting is routinely used as a direct risk mitigation, is the seed capital portfolio. The risk positions \\nare actively offset within an approved tolerance of 6%.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nFinancial Risk\\n  \\n\\n51\\n \\nRisk Reporting and Monitoring \\nA limit structure for the Group investments is in place which is regularly monitored to ensure the portfolio remains within risk \\ntolerance levels. \\nThe co-investment portfolio is also subject to bi-annual reviews at the underlying fund level to ensure the risk profile is maintained \\nand any emerging risks are escalated where necessary. \\nAd hoc monitoring and/or reviews of any aspect of the financial risk portfolio are carried out as and when required. For new co-\\ninvestments and seed capital requests, for example, there is a clearly defined approval authority matrix dependent on the \\nquantum of risk involved. All requests are reviewed by the Capital Investment Committee (CIC) and escalated to the requisite \\ndelegated authority. \\nKey Drivers and Sensitivities for Market Risk \\nAs noted above, our market risk exposure is driven by the capital at risk deployed by us via, for example, co-investments or seed \\ncapital into portfolios, and/or where a financial claim against us is inherent in the product (such as Guaranteed Products). \\nThe table below shows the primary balance sheet entries that are susceptible to market risk.

Prior period had been adjusted respectively. \\nSeed Capital \\nSeed is typically deployed in our traditional asset class portfolios which are more liquid than those into which we make co- \\ninvestments and as such are more exposed to the daily volatility of market prices in addition to the other factors outlined in the co-\\ninvestment section below. \\nHowever, the risk is mitigated via: (i) the typically short tenor (3-12 months), and (ii) the offsetting risk positions used by us to limit \\nthe net risk to a defined tracking error threshold. It is this latter factor that obviates the need to produce a sensitivity for this \\nportfolio. These offsetting positions are classified as free standing derivatives and shown in the balance sheet as positive market \\nvalues from derivative financial instruments.

Such events can be market related or idiosyncratic. Key events can include: \\n\\n−Economic environment: Material economic downturn impacting the value of the underlying fund investments, particularly in\\nkey markets of Real Estate, Infrastructure, Sustainables and Private Equity.\\n−Geo-political risk: Material geo-political events impacting the value of underlying fund investments such as the US-China\\ntrade dispute or a political shift in willingness to support or subsidize certain industries (notably in the Sustainables sector).\\n−Equity prices: Impact on underlying investments of a change in equity prices in turn impacting the value of co-investment in\\nthe relevant funds (despite latter being unlisted/illiquid).\\n−Commodity prices: Impact on underlying investments of a change in commodity prices in turn impacting the value of co-\\ninvestment in the relevant funds e.g. impact of oil price drop on oil & gas sector facing funds.\\n−Foreign Exchange (FX): Impact on reported value of co-investments of movements in foreign currencies (notably USD)\\nrelative to EUR; direct impact on underlying investments notably in global funds.\\n−Interest rates: Impact of interest rate moves on funds invested in debt instruments and/or providing loans (e.g. Sustainable\\nfunds). Wider, indirect impact of rising interest rates on investor appetite for investment in alternative funds. Expected only to\\nhave a peripheral impact as the bulk of investor interest is driven by alternative market specifics.\\n−Idiosyncratic risk: financial risk can also occur as a result of properties which are specific to a particular asset or liability and\\nindependent of above risk drivers such as leverage, management quality or fraud.\\nSharp valuation decreases of co-investments directly impact our profits via reduction of fair value. In addition, fee income is \\nnegatively affected as result of lower asset value of the underlying fund. Furthermore, potential issues in current or future capital \\nraising and/or reputational/litigation risk may arise. \\nSensitivity \\nAssumptions: The Real Estate sector represents the single largest contributor to the co-investment portfolio and, accordingly, the \\nsensitivity analysis focuses on this market segment, applying blanket percentage value reductions to the component elements o f \\nour real estate fund portfolio. Two levels of market stress have been assumed (20% and 40%) with the latter representing the \\npeak depreciation in value seen in certain real estate markets during the global financial crisis. Using blanket market stresses i s \\nconsidered a highly conservative approach given that different sub-sectors and regions of the real estate market react to different \\ndegrees to any given market movement. In addition, it has been assumed that a movement in the value of the underlying assets \\nhas a commensurate and immediate impact on the value of our co-investment (again, a conservative assumption given the \\ntypical degree of diversification). \\nThe other key assumption relates to leverage within the fund(s). The level of leverage varies by fund and depends on the risk \\nprofile of the individual funds. Since the global financial crisis, the leverage levels have reduced as investors are seeking \\nsustainable performance.  \\nMethodology \\nThe funds in which the Group is co-invested are valued at least annually by third party auditors based on fundamental analysis of \\nthe underlying assets and their respective performance relative to when they were acquired by the fund. Finance use these \\nexternal valuations as the basis for their own valuation, adjusting the external figure where necessary to allow for the structure of \\nour investment and information or evidence about potential impairment. For the sensitivity analysis, a percentage stress factor \\nhas been applied to the internal valuation, adjusting for fund leverage where necessary, to arrive at an estimated impact on our \\nprofits.  \\nCo-investment sensitivity for potential changes in real estate values \\nEstimated net P&L impact \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Dec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n\\nReduction in real estate value:\\n \\n\\n20%\\n \\n (52\\n)\\n \\n(53\\n)\\n \\n\\n40%\\n \\n (104\\n)\\n \\n(107\\n)\\n \\n\\nIncrease in real estate value:\\n \\n\\n20%\\n \\n 52\\n \\n53\\n \\n\\n40%\\n \\n 104\\n \\n107\\n \\n\\n8\\n  Includes Strategic Investments where the inherent risks are similar to those identified for co-investments albeit amplified given the importance of the investment to the Group.

A provision is booked, aligned to the long dated maturity of the underlying guarantees.   \\nThe guarantee shortfall is particularly sensitive to movements in the long-dated interest rate curves and can also fluctuate due to \\nchanges in: \\n−Market development: In addition to changes in long-dated interest rates, the shortfall is also impacted by changes in equity\\nprices, volatility and other market factors impacting the Net Asset Value (e.g. performance of underlying assets and funds);\\n−Changes in client behaviour, e.g. decreases in cancellation rates increase the shortfall as do client contributions if made in a\\nlow interest rate environment;\\n−Model assumptions: The shortfall calculation can be influenced by changes in model assumptions and the timing of the\\nmarket data snapshot used.\\nSensitivity \\nAssumptions: For the sensitivity illustrated in the table below, the key driver to which stresses are applied is the long term \\ninterest rate (25 Year Euro Swap Rate) which is the most significant of the various factors that can influence the guarantee \\nshortfall (outlined above). \\nAll other factors influencing the shortfall are assumed to remain static. \\nMethodology \\nThe shortfall is calculated through a Monte-Carlo based simulation using stochastic interest rates and equities for a CPPI \\nstrategy. The CPPI mechanism rebalances the asset allocation individually for each client account. The model allows simulation \\nof future contributions, cancellation rates and management/distribution/account fees. The current implementation calculates risk \\nbased on a representative sample of accounts and scales sample risk to the population size. \\nGuarantee shortfall sensitivity for potential changes in long term interest rate \\nEstimated net P&L impact \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Dec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n\\nReduction in long term interest rate:\\n \\n\\n50 bp\\n \\n (20\\n)\\n \\n(14\\n)\\n \\n\\n100 bp\\n \\n (46\\n)\\n \\n(34\\n)\\n \\n\\n200 bp\\n \\n 0\\n \\n0\\n \\n\\nIncrease in long term interest rate:\\n \\n\\n50 bp\\n \\n 15\\n \\n10\\n \\n\\n100 bp\\n \\n 27\\n \\n18\\n \\n\\n200 bp\\n \\n 0\\n \\n0\\n \\n\\nThe sensitivity of the guarantee shortfall to long term interest rates is not linear, with reductions in the long term interest rate \\nhaving a far greater impact on the underlying value of the funds subject to the guarantee than increases of a similar magnitude. \\nThe resulting shortfall is shown in the balance sheet as a derivative, included in negative market values from derivative financial \\ninstruments. Changes in the estimated P&L impact between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, primarily resulted from \\nchanges in interest rates.  \\nWe monitor and mitigate interest rate risk in accordance with our risk management process where appropriate. The range of \\ninstruments considered include long-dated bonds, long-dated interest rate swaps or swaptions. The Group will enter into \\nappropriate bond exposures or swap agreements as and when necessary to retain a balanced risk position in line with our risk \\nappetite and strategic goals. \\nPension & Equity Compensation Risk \\nThe key driver of Pension Risk is the potential for market movements to reduce the value of the investments held by the portfolio \\nand/or increase the value of the associated liabilities. Key risk factors include interest rates, inflation, credit spreads and equity \\nvalues. The overall risk increases with reduction in plan contributions as plans mature (no new entrants), increased or offset by \\nchanges in the longevity profile of the pensioner population.

For the Group, credit risk \\nexposure relates primarily to cash and cash equivalent positions that are placed with third party banking and financial institutions, \\ntypically overnight but also, in certain circumstances, for longer periods. The counterparties are monitored via market parameters, \\nthe usage of independent credit rating agencies and proprietary analysis. The related credit risk to the third party institutions is \\naggregated and managed through the definition of appropriate limits.  \\nFor new cash exposures there is a clearly defined approval authority matrix dependent on the quantum of risk involved. \\nTo further diversify counterparty risk in our corporate liquidity management, other options have been utilized, including investing \\nin US Government securities and Money Market Funds (MMF). Additionally, through the purchase of German sub-sovereign \\nbonds the credit risk has been further diversified. Due to the ultra-long maturity of these instruments, they simultaneously serve \\nas a proxy hedge to the interest rate risk of our Guaranteed Products. All diversification items contribute to our market ris k \\npositions.

This\\nrepresents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within twelve months of the\\nreporting date, assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition.\\n−Stage 2: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (LTECL) for those\\nFinancial Assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The\\nassessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on measuring changes in counterparty probability of default (PD) or if\\ncontractual payments are 30 days past due. This requires the computation of expected credit losses (ECL) based on lifetime\\nprobability of default (LTPD) that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the financi al\\nasset. Allowance for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk and the impact of a longer time\\nhorizon being considered compared to twelve months in Stage 1.\\n−Stage 3: The Group recognizes a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, reflecting a probability\\nof default (PD) of 100%, via the recoverable cash flows for the asset, for those financial assets that are credit-impaired. The\\nGroup’s definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition. The treatment of loans  in stage 3 remains substantially the\\nsame as the treatment of impaired loans under IAS 39 except for homogeneous portfolios.\\nThe calculation of ECL considers amongst others internal and external credit rating of the counterparts, loan loss provision take n \\nprior to implementation of IFRS 9 and transactions past due.  \\nAs of December 31, 2020 the financial assets at amortized cost include cash and bank balances in the amount of € 2,189 millio n \\nwith pre-tax ECL stage 1 of € 0,1 million (December 31, 2019: € 2 ,086 million with pre-tax ECL stage 1 of € 0.1 million), other \\nfinancial assets at amortized cost of € 827 million with pre -tax ECL stage 1 of € 0,6 million and pre -tax ECL stage 2 of \\n€ 0,6 million (December 31, 2019: € 1,331 million with pre -tax ECL stage 1 of € 0.7 million and pre-tax ECL stage 2 of \\n€ 0.6 million) as well as loans at amortized cost of € 4 million with pre -tax ECL stage 1 of € 0 million (December 31, 2019: € 3 \\nmillion with pre-tax ECL stage 1 of € 0 million). For the off -balance sheet commitments of € 128 million pre-tax ECL stage 1 of     \\n€ 0.3 million (December 31, 2019: € 119 million reflect pre -tax ECL stage 1 of € 1.1 million) is reflected.  \\nStrategic Risk \\nStrategic Risk is the risk of an operating income shortfall due to lower than expected performance in revenues not compensated \\nby a reduction in costs. Strategic Risk may arise from a decline in our assets under management driven by changes in asset \\nvalues, from our ability to attract and retain assets under management and maintain competitive investment performance or from  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nFinancial Risk\\n  \\n\\n56\\n \\nchanges to the competitive landscape or regulatory framework. Strategic Risk could also arise due to a failure to execute strategy \\nand/or failure to effectively take actions to address underperformance.  \\nThe Strategic and Capital plan is approved annually by the Executive Board. During the year, execution of business strategy is \\nregularly monitored to assess the performance against strategic objectives and to seek to ensure we remain on track to achiev e \\ntargets. \\nLiquidity Risk \\nLiquidity risk is the risk arising from our potential inability to meet all payment obligations when they come due or only being able \\nto meet these obligations at excessive costs. The objective of the Group’s liquidity risk management framewo rk is to ensure that it \\ncan fulfil its payment obligations at all times and can manage liquidity and funding risks within the agreed risk appetite. The \\nframework considers relevant and significant drivers of liquidity risk, whether on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet as well as \\nexpected future cash flows. \\nCapital and Liquidity Management is mandated to manage the overall liquidity and funding position of the Group as well as the \\nliquidity risk profile. Risk oversees the application of the liquidity risk framework and adherence to the risk appetite as approved \\nby the Executive Board. \\nThe Group proactively manages liquidity risks by: \\n−Maintaining a liquid balance sheet with a prudent cash buffer and limited leverage\\n−Assessing and monitoring liquidity and liquidity risks on a monthly basis and presenting the results to the RCC\\n−Stress testing of liquidity by applying a combined, market and idiosyncratic stress event in which the Group needs to remain\\nsolvent over a prolonged period of stress (up to eight weeks )\\n−Performing a rolling 12-month cash flow forecast, which is also stressed as part of the monthly stress testing\\n−Maintaining a funding plan to assess upcoming funding demands and sources\\n−Maintaining contingency funding procedures to enable swift and coordinated action and decision making in a liquidity crisis\\nevent\\nThe Group uses stress testing and scenario analysis to evaluate the impact of sudden and severe stress events on our corporat e \\nliquidity position. It models the behaviour of our cash and cash-like investments position including on- and off-balance sheet in- \\nand outflows and results in available liquidity after stress. \\nIn line with the defined liquidity risk appetite, we aim to maintain a global level of available liquidity of € 600 million a t all times. At \\nDecember 31, 2020, available liquidity both within the stressed 8-week horizon and after a stressed 12-month period were \\nsignificantly above the threshold.  \\nLiquidity risk is an area of lesser concern for the Group due to the cash generating nature of our business and the conservative \\nfunding profile of our balance sheet. We principally fund the business through equity and cash generated from operations. We \\nmay, however, raise debt funding to address specific funding demands that may arise as part of growing the business. \\nAs part of the annual strategic planning process, we project the development of the key liquidity and funding metrics based on the \\nunderlying business plans to ensure that the plan is in compliance with risk appetite. This includes maintaining a funding plan to \\nspecifically assess upcoming funding demands and sources to accommodate projected seed and co- investments within the \\nrespective limits.  \\nTo diversify our funding and access to liquidity, we have put in place a multicurrency revolving credit facility (RCF) in the amount \\nof € 500 million for general corporate purposes under which there were no drawings as of December 31, 2020.  \\nThe following tables present an analysis of our contractual undiscounted cash flows of liabilities based upon earliest legally \\nexercisable maturity as of December 31, 2020.

The \\nremainder of € 1,330 million (December 31, 2019 € 1,291 million) covers payables resulting from operational business activities \\nand a provision for guaranteed funds shortfall. These positions are monitored and accounted for in our liquidity risk framework. \\nThe above table focuses on the maturity of liabilities. Receivables from operating business activity are not reflected.  \\nRisk Diversification and Concentration \\nRisk Concentrations  \\nRisk concentrations refer to clusters of the same or similar risk drivers within specific risk types (intra-risk concentrations in \\noperational, credit, market, liquidity and other risks). They could occur within and across counterparties, businesses, \\nregions/countries, industries and products. The management of concentrations is integrated as part of the management of \\nindividual risk types (e.g. operational, credit, market, liquidity risk management) and monitored on an ongoing basis, with the key \\nobjective to avoid any risk concentrations. This is supported by limit setting on different levels and/or management according to \\nrisk type. \\nRisk Type Diversification Benefit \\nThe risk type diversification benefit quantifies diversification effects between operational, credit, market and strategic risk in the \\ncapital adequacy assessments. To the extent correlations between these risk types fall below 1.0, a risk type diversification \\nbenefit results. The calculation of the risk type diversification benefit is intended to ensure that the standalone capital for the \\nindividual risk types are aggregated in an economically meaningful way.

Processes are executed by multiple Front-Office and \\ncontrol functions (Investment Guidelines, Risk, Legal, and Compliance) and governed by policies, procedures, and oversight \\nbodies (committees and regional/global management boards). \\nIdentification and Assessment: The investment portfolio liquidity risk management identification and assessment process \\nconsiders a wide array of liquidity risk factors. Among them are the portfolio’s strategy, the portfolio’s asset liquidity, and different \\nliquidity demand scenarios such as investor redemptions and margin/collateral calls. Each portfolio’s liquidity risk is measu red \\nacross multiple dimensions, such as the time to liquidate portfolio holdings, the cost attributed to such liquidation, and the effect \\nthe liquidation would have on portfolio’s future liquidity composition.  \\nThe portfolio’s asset liquidity is measured by taking into account asset and market specific factors such as securities’  listing \\nstatus, trading platform, and settlement period, as well as ongoing trading observables, e.g. quotes and observable trades. \\nLiquidity demand scenarios are estimated applying a historical Redemption- at-Risk approach if applicable or elsewise defaul t \\nscenarios. In addition, liquidity stress tests are run to simulate the impact of stress conditions, e.g. market depth decline , \\nincreasing liquidation cost and/or atypical redemption requests on portfolio’s liquidity risk.  \\nMetrics are calculated and refreshed - where applicable  – with updated trading and market data at least weekly through the \\nenterprise wide system, Aladdin. The system is supplemented by additional Group trading and valuation control data. The metrics \\nare available to control as well as front-office functions via reports and direct system access.  \\nFor efficient communication, a liquidity score is assigned to each portfolio based on a liquidity metrics weighted aggregatio n \\nscheme which is supplemented by a qualitative assessment performed b y risk managers. In addition, each portfolio’s liquidity risk \\nrelative to investment strategy and redemption obligations is reviewed through a formal annual risk review process.  \\nMonitoring and Mitigation: Risk performs monitoring for limit utilization on liquidity metrics on a weekly/monthly basis. The limit \\nstructure consists of regulatory/internal limits and warning thresholds. Escalation chains and contingency planning are clearly \\ndefined within the liquidity governance framework. Limit breaches of weekly monitored statistics are escalated at once while the \\nothers are discussed with portfolio management as part of the monthly portfolio risk and performance review process.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nFiduciary Investment Risk\\n  \\n\\n59\\n \\nDWS has adjusted selected aspects and components of its liquidity risk identification, assessment, monitoring and mitigation \\nprocesses in response to the COVID-19 related market turmoil. Changes to model methodologies and model parameters were \\nperformed to account for the stress market conditions between February and March 2020. Swing pricing was applied for selected \\nfunds to manage liquidity risk during these stress market conditions. Furthermore, liquidity risk monitoring was intensified during \\nthe first half of 2020. The scope of liquidity management tools available to funds as per regulation was increased throughout the \\nyear.  \\nFiduciary Investment Risk in Alternative Asset Classes \\nWhereas market prices are available on a daily basis for traditional assets, alternative assets are in most cases much more \\nilliquid, or prices are not directly observable. In these cases, regular valuations take place reflecting the illiquidity of alternative \\nassets. Measurement and control processes are undertaken on a monthly or quarterly basis rather than daily.  \\nInvestment Risk Management \\nThe methodology for the alternative risk management requires the involvement of our expertise in the asset \\nacquisition/divestment process, credit analysis where appropriate, regular stress testing and calculation and monitoring of \\nleverage, where applicable.  \\nWe have defined an appropriate catalogue of criteria which are observed in order to measure risk. This catalogue differs among \\nthe different sub-asset classes in Alternatives, e.g. real estate, infrastructure debt, private equity, fund of funds and collateralized \\nloan obligations (CLOs). Warning thresholds are established and consumption reported regularly to management. \\nIdentification of Risk in Alternatives \\nThe risk management function is responsible for identifying the material risks of the portfolios, which is defined as the risk of \\ndecreasing market values of the positions in the portfolios. This risk is considered material, in case it leads to a significant loss for \\nthe investor with a sufficient probability. Due to changing market conditions and volatilities as well as trading activities, the market \\nrisk for a given portfolio changes over time. The relevant risks to be taken into account, as well as traditional market risks and \\nthese specific to assets in the Alternatives range, are:  \\n−Interest rate risk\\n−FX risk\\n−Volatility risk\\n−Commodity risk\\n−Inflation risk\\n−Real estate risk\\n−Credit risk\\nInternal warning thresholds are implemented for the relevant criteria at level of the individual asset (or contract) and at level of the \\nentire portfolio. Levels close to the warning threshold of the portfolio are being regularly discussed and flagged to the respective \\nAlternatives investment committees or boards of the management companies, whereas individual assets are being monitored \\nseparately. The monitoring of individual assets may be triggered by reaching internal warning thresholds or by violation of \\ncontractually defined limits. If such case occurs, an asset is included in a watch list jointly overseen by portfolio management and \\nrisk management, which triggers regular monitoring, and decision on mitigating action with regard to the items on the watch list. If \\ninvestments further deteriorate, specialists for work-out or other stress scenarios will be involved. \\nLiquidity Risk Management \\nLiquidity risk is the risk arising from potential inability to meet investor redemptions or other liquidity demands within a requested \\ntime period (liquidation period). Liquidity risk arises due to expected or unexpected investor redemption or other liabilities for \\npayment such as settlements of foreign exchange forward transactions or margin calls which have to be met by the current cash \\npositions or by selling assets to generate cash. Hence the liquidity risk management framework considers both, the specific \\nliquidation risk of the individual investments and the overall risk of the portfolio to generate liquidity. Within the product range of \\nAlternatives, open ended funds and closed end funds require a different kind of liquidity risk management.  \\nIdentification and Assessment: Measurement of the liquidity risk compares possible liquidity needs with asset liquidity and is \\nsummarized in a liquidity profile, which aggregates available liquidity by time buckets, taking into account the time it takes to \\nliquidate assets. In addition, Risk defines further internal limits where appropriate.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nSustainability Risk\\n  \\n\\n60\\n \\nMitigation and Monitoring: Liquidity risk primarily affects open end funds and is addressed by respective provisions within the \\nfunds. We monitor frequently the liquidity limit utilization. Appropriate thresholds are defined and consumption of the capacity \\nwithin limits is reported to the relevant levels of management. Indications for high probability of a limit breach trigger immediate \\nescalation and mitigation actions.  \\nCounterparty Risk \\nCounterparty Risk relates to the potential losses arising when a counterparty cannot (or does not) fulfil its obligation in a \\ntransaction. In the context of the Group, counterparties are typically 3rd party with direct market access (broker) or derivative \\ncounterparties.  \\nCounterparty risks are identified via market signals (e.g. credit spreads, swap rates, ratings, investment grade rating) as well as \\nby the regular review of counterparty limits for approved counterparties. Each counterparty must be rated and each rating has to \\nbe reviewed regularly. Monitoring and escalation of limit excesses ensures appropriate oversight. Additionally, International \\nSwaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) or ISDA like agreements typically include counterparty downgrade triggers, requiring \\ncollateralisation or termination, to protect our clients.   \\nSustainability Risk \\nOver the recent years we have been monitoring the increased attention to the question of the integration of sustainability risks in \\nthe risk management processes of financial institutions. Among others, the draft publications of the amendments of the EU \\nregulatory framework as well as publications and recommendations given on NCA level (such as the BaFin Guidance Notice \\npublished in December 2019) have been given special focus. \\nThe German regulator BaFin published a non-binding guidance notice on dealing with sustainability risk in December 2019 in \\nwhich BaFin lays out supervisory expectations on the integration of sustainability risk in the identification, assessment, monitoring \\nand management of all (material) risks. As part of the ESG Regulatory Governance Programme (please refer to ‘Compliance and \\nControl - ESG Regulatory Compliance’), a thorough analysis of the guidelines was carried out in order to understand the \\nimplications for DWS and to build a strong basis for the development of business requirements. During an impact assessment \\ninvolving various business functions and project workstreams, specific ambitions for the implementation with regard to each \\nrequirement were defined. The integration of the identified implications of the BaFin Guidance Notice has been ongoing in 202 0 \\nand will be further continued across 2021 as part of the ESG Regulatory Governance Programme. \\nSustainability Risks and Sustainability Factors  \\nSustainability risk means an environmental, social, or governance event or condition that could potentially or actually cause  a \\nnegative material impact on an investment’s value. These events or conditions are split into \"Environment, Social, and \\nGovernance\" (ESG), and can either be of a macroeconomic nature or directly related to the activities of DWS or an investee \\ncompany contained in a portfolio managed by us.  \\nSustainability events or conditions relate, among other things, to the following topics: \\n−“Environmental” factors can for example be reduction of carbon footprint, avoidance of waste, and sustainable land use.\\n−Relevant “Social” factors are among st others compliance with recognized labour law standards, diversity, and guarantee of\\nadequate product safety.\\n−“Governance” factors include tax honesty, anti -corruption measures, and data protection.\\nAs part of “Environmental” issues, we consider especial ly the following macroeconomic sustainability events and conditions \\nrelated to climate change:  \\n−Physical climate factors, including extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and forest fires as well as long-term\\nclimate change leading for example to rising sea levels, unstable weather conditions and ocean acidification.\\n−Climate transition factors, for example policy measures, technological change and changes in customer preferences\\nassociated with the transition to a low-carbon economy.\\nFrom our point of view, sustainability risks as well as the underlying sustainability factors cannot simply be seen as one additional \\nrisk type to be managed and monitored besides the existing risk types. This is due to the fact that sustainability factors can have \\nan effect on several of the already known risk types. More precisely, sustainability risks could materialize within any of the risks \\nmanaged (see also the previous sections for further details):  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nSustainability Risk\\n  \\n\\n61\\n \\n−Financial risk on the corporate level comprises credit risk, non-trading market risk, liquidity risk and strategic risk.\\n−Non-financial risk on the corporate level comprises operational risk and reputational risk.\\n−Investment risk comprises risk at the portfolio level and consists of market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, as well as any\\nother risks investors of products managed by us might be exposed to.\\nThe following risks are considered material given our business model: \\nInvestment market risk: Several shares of companies contained within the portfolio of a fund managed by us could operate their \\nbusiness in a non-sustainable way or might be exposed to significant climate change factors. An abrupt change in the market \\nview or the materialization of climate change events might lead to devaluations of these shares which ultimately leads to losses \\nfor investors of the fund. \\nStrategic risk: Subsequent to the changes implemented in EU regulations with regards to the EU Action Plan, the product \\nportfolio manufactured and managed by us could potentially no longer meet client expectations with regard to a diverse and \\nappropriate offering of sustainable investment products. The redemptions as well as missing subscriptions we could face linked to \\nthis situation might expose us to a strategic sustainability risk.  \\nReputational risk: The products manufactured by us labelled with a specific sustainability related label  (such as “ESG” or “SDG”) \\ncould potentially unveil to be only supposedly sustainable products. Besides the potential regulatory fines linked to this incident, \\nESG aware investors could withdraw their money from ESG labelled products or even other products managed by us. \\nWe consider all of the above sustainability risks to be relevant for integration into our risk management and control framework. \\nWe therefore continue to integrate processes addressing these risk types into our current existing risk measurement and \\nmanagement frameworks enabling us to consider issues such as climate change within our corporate and portfolio risks \\nassessments. \\nIn 2020, we developed a dedicated DWS sustainability risk definition tailored to our business model and the risks related to our \\nbusiness activities. This process also included a scenario-based determination of groups of risks being materially affected by \\nsustainability factors. The DWS sustainability risk definition and its integration in the risk taxonomy, relevant sustainability factors, \\nand the risk and control governance structure to manage sustainability risks are defined and documented in our newly \\nestablished Sustainability Risk Policy. \\nAdditionally, a dedicated implementation program to integrate sustainability risks and sustainability factors into the set of risk \\ntypes identified as material started in 2020 and will be continued in 2021. \\nIntegration of Sustainability Risk in Corporate Risk Management \\nSustainability risks, or more precisely sustainability factors, have already been part of the reputational risk assessment processes \\nwhere in particular social, environmental, governance as well as sectorial factors have been considered within the overall ri sk \\nassessment of new products manufactured by us. \\nDuring the analysis of impacted risk types that formed the basis for our sustainability risk definition, several further corporate \\nfinancial and non-financial risk types have been identified to be impacted by sustainability factors. Besides reputational risks, \\nwhich have already been reflecting some of the factors, non-financial risks, strategic risks, and market and counterparty risks \\nhave been identified to be impacted. \\nIn 2020, a sustainability risk impact assessment across a wide range of risk types has been performed, which determined the \\nrelevance of sustainability factors for individual risk types. Following this analysis, changes to the related control processes and \\ngovernance have started to be initiated and will be continued to be implemented over the course of 2021. The Reputational Risk \\nManagement standards and processes have been developed further to reflect the increased attention to and relevance of \\nsustainability factors and sustainability risks. Additionally, we developed a concept for the assessment of strategic risk related to \\nsustainability factors, which may include amongst others the changing customer preferences towards more sustainable products. \\nIn 2021, the impact assessment on the range of risk types will be extended and identified changes will be implemented. A \\nstrategic risk scenario analysis will be conducted and the development of processes to identify and manage reputational risks and \\noperational risks impacted by sustainability factors will be continued.   \\nFinally, in line with the suggestions given in the BaFin Guidance Notice on the integration of sustainability risks, the risk \\ngovernance processes including the risk inventory, the risk strategy as well as the risk appetite statement will be amended t o \\nreflect the continuously developing business strategy as well as the evolving impact of sustainability risks on the organization.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nBusiness Continuity and Crisis Management\\n  \\n\\n62\\n \\nIntegration of Sustainability Risk in Investment Risk Management \\nSustainability risk and sustainability factors have been identified to potentially have significant impacts on the risk profiles of the \\nportfolios, for both liquid traditional as well as illiquid alternative asset classes. \\nThe variety of sustainability factors potentially having an impact on the individual values of assets or investments contained in a \\nmanaged portfolio, led to the conclusion that a comprehensive measurement and management of sustainability risks requires a \\ndiverse set of risk indicators and measures. \\nFor this purpose, several ratings established on issuer level, including the climate transition risk rating as well as a rating linked to \\nthe norm controversies (please refer to ‘ Responsibility around our fiduciary value chain - Responsible Investing and ESG \\nProducts’) will be used to assess the overall sustainability risk profile of a fund. In 2020, a methodology to determine the portfolio \\nsustainability risk profile for liquid investment portfolios was developed based on a set of meaningful and relevant ESG signals. \\nThese ESG signals forming the basis for the portfolio risk profiles include amongst others:  \\n−Norm controversy ratings linked to standards-based screening focused on human rights abuses, child or forced labour, health\\nand safety, environmental impact, and business ethics.\\n−Corporate best-in-class ESG ratings that seek to identify leaders and laggards with regards to ESG issues within a peer group.\\n−Climate risks and opportunities ratings including carbon price risk ratings.\\nConsidering the composition of positions held within a portfolio, these ESG signals are aggregated on portfolio level according to \\na methodology developed in 2020 to obtain dedicated sustainability indicators covering the diverse aspects of sustainability risk. \\nIn 2021, a dedicated product level governance will be rolled out for a wide range of portfolios managed by us to establish an \\nindependent risk steering of sustainability risk on a portfolio level. With the continuous development of ESG signals for the illiquid \\nalternative asset classes, the concept will also be rolled out in 2021 to real estate funds and other illiquid asset classes.  \\nBesides these rating based indicators, stress scenarios and stress tests can be used to assess the exposure and the sensitivity of \\na portfolio towards individual sustainability risks and sustainability factors. The underlying assumptions might be influenced by \\ncombinations of macroeconomic (such as climate transition or physical climate factors) as well as company-specific indicators \\n(such as UN Norm compliance). Such stress tests can be integrated in the stress testing frameworks already established by our \\nInvestment Risk function. Physical climate stress scenarios as well as climate transition stress scenarios are planned to be \\nintegrated in the market risk stress testing program executed by the investment management functions in 2021.  \\nBusiness Continuity and Crisis Management  \\nBusiness Continuity Management (BCM) Program \\nWe are committed to protecting our staff and ensuring the continuity of critical group businesses and functions in order to protect \\nour franchise, mitigate risks, safeguard client services and sustain both stable financial markets and customer confidence. W e \\nhave developed, implemented and continue to test and maintain our global BCM program to ensure it attains these objectives. \\nThe BCM program outlines core procedures for the relocation  or the recovery of operations in response to varying levels of \\ndisruption. A number of scenarios are considered including: staff unavailability, complete loss  of a single production site, loss of \\nvendor services and loss of application software. These procedures provide information for responsible personnel  to evaluate the \\nbusiness disruption and initiate appropriate action, including:  \\n−safeguard employees\\' and our property,\\n−communicate with our employees, regulators, and clients,\\n−provide our client with access to their funds and securities, and−protect our books and records and recover/resume normal operations.\\nEach of our core businesses functions and infrastructure groups construct and maintain their business continuity plans (BCPs) to \\nensure a continuous, reliable service. BCPs are based on predefined strategies, roles and responsibilities. BCPs are designed to \\nensure provision of critical business processes and IT systems within predefined recovery time frames. BCPs are reviewed, \\nupdated and tested annually or when changes occur.  \\nIn support of our BCM program, we maintain technical disaster recovery plans  to protect and recover applications, information \\nassets and technical infrastructure in the event of a facility failure or technology outage.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nBusiness Continuity and Crisis Management\\n  \\n\\n63\\n \\nRoles & Responsibilities  \\nThe BCM program has defined roles  and responsibilities, which are documented  in our corporate standards. This fosters a \\ncompanywide approach to the provision of resiliency throughout the Group and results in a group wide fit-for-purpose business \\ncontinuity capability. The BCM program is staffed and managed within each region by specialists who co-ordinate preparedness \\nefforts with BCM-trained staff embedded in each business and infrastructure area. The regional business continuity teams \\nprovide expertise and guidance to all business functions in developing, implementing, testing and maintaining effective BCPs and \\nrecovery processes. Similarly, technical disaster recovery standards are implemented regionally by our technology department.  \\nThe Executive Board retains overall responsibility for policy setting, supervision and effective implementation of the business \\ncontinuity policy and has delegated responsibility for business process disruption risk  to the Chief Operating Officer (COO). The \\ncompliance with corporate standards is monitored regionally  by a regional business continuity council, reporting  on a quarterly \\nbasis to the global business continuity council. Regular reports - at least once a year - are submitted to senior management. \\nCrisis Management & Implementation  \\nOur COO ensures a clearly defined, documented  and tested crisis management process for assessing, escalating and managing \\nany business disruption that may affect our ability to continue its critical business operations. This includes a crisis contact and \\nescalation process, which is tested on a regular basis. In addition, BCPs are designed to be implemented in response to varying \\nlevels of business disruptions. The nature of the business disruption will affect whether all or only parts of our plans are executed. \\nBusiness Continuity Recovery Solutions  \\nWe have a broad recovery program in place to deal with the impact of incident or crisis. A number  of customized recovery \\nsolutions have been designed to facilitate the quickest possible resumption  of work for the critical businesses and support functions. \\nExamples of these are: \\nAlternate Sites \\nWe are using self-managed, dedicated standby facilities. These recovery sites provide dedicated recovery seats and \\ninfrastructure to provide for the needs of the business. Additionally, we retain recovery sites contractually through service \\nproviders who concentrate on business resiliency. All recovery sites are physically separated from normal business locations to \\nprevent both sites being affected by the same incident. \\nWork-from-home (Remote Access) \\nWhere permitted, employees can work remotely from home over a secure line and redirect their phone to either a landline or \\nmobile phone. \\nReciprocal Agreements \\nSome businesses have partnership agreements with other business units regarding the allocation of a required number of \\nrecovery seats or the ability to transfer work. The receiving business unit provides the necessary infrastructure, hardware facilities \\nor staff. Both normal business locations are geographically separated from each other to prevent both sites being affected by the \\nsame incident. \\nIT Disaster Recovery (DR) \\nIT Disaster Recovery planning takes into consideration possible disruption scenarios such as a loss of data center or the failure of \\nspecific IT assets and/or applications supporting critical business operations. In order to address these scenarios, confidential DR \\nplans are in place to manage the recovery and continuation of operations from DR environments located at geographically \\nseparate sites. All DR plans are validated periodically and include the assessment of recovery time and recovery point objectives \\nas well as technical and business validation to ensure that the DR environments operate at the required level. \\nDisplacement Strategy \\nCertain business processes can be switched from one location to another and in the longer term, key staff can move to another \\nlocation unaffected by the incident.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nRisk Report\\n \\n\\nBusiness Continuity and Crisis Management\\n  \\n\\n64\\n \\nService Providers \\nService providers are contractually obliged to have business continuity capabilities in place to ensure continuity of service s \\nprovided to us if the ordinary operation of the service provider is disrupted and to modify their work stream in order to adapt with \\nour business continuity organization. A vendor risk management process is in place to ensure compliance. \\nPandemic Planning \\nWe maintain a risk-based approach to pandemic planning, using as a guide the World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of \\npandemic phases. \\nCOVID-19 \\nWhen COVID-19 first arrived, we were able to immediately start implementing the pandemic plan at all offices and during 2020 \\nwe actively managed the possible impact for the company and closely monitored the development of the situation in all regions to \\nprotect our staff and clients. We continue to communicate frequently with our employees with updates on the rapidly developin g \\nCOVID-19 situation, including with precautionary health and hygiene reminders.  \\nWe encourage our staff to take preventive actions to help limit the spread of respiratory viruses. This includes in particula r \\nheightened hygiene measures following the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO). \\nIn addition, we restrict travel to absolutely critical business travel only. These business trips have to be exceptionally pre-\\napproved by our senior management prior to booking. Travel restrictions are under constant review and are updated as \\nnecessary. Audio and video conference meetings are encouraged where possible. Employees who return from affected areas, or \\nwho have household members that return from such areas, are asked to self-quarantine immediately after their return for a period \\nof 14 days. \\nThe proactive precautions we continue to take have no impact on our operations and all client service continue unaffected. Al l \\nareas of our business remain fully operational and, as described above, we were and are fully prepared and equipped to address \\nany adverse impact that COVID-19 may have on the delivery of services. We will continue with our split-team approach globally, \\nwith teams rotating between separated business locations (both normal and dedicated standby offices) or home. We were and \\nare also capable of ensuring work-from-home for all our employees at the same time, if necessary  – including portfolio \\nmanagement. We will maintain our risk-based approach using the recommendations of the WHO and the national health \\nministries, to preserve the health of our employees and to ensure all areas of our business remain fully operational. \\nCustomer and Client Access to Funds and Securities \\nIf the usual access to funds, securities and/or investment accounts are impacted by a significant business disruption, we will \\nadvise our customer and clients of the appropriate DWS contacts through expedient means at  www.dws.com. \\nAudit \\nOur BCM Program is subject to regular reviews by internal and external audit, and regulatory authorities.  \\nRegulatory Obligations \\nIn the case of conflict between the Business Continuity Policies and Standards  or the Technical Disaster Recovery Standards and \\nlocal regulatory obligations, the stricter obligation is adhered to.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nCompliance and Control\\n  \\n\\n[Compliance and Control in DWS Group]\\n  \\n\\n65\\n \\nCompliance and Control \\n[Compliance and Control in DWS Group] \\nAs a global fiduciary business, an effective compliance culture enables DWS to perform its duties towards clients in safeguarding \\nclient assets. This includes risk management processes such as risk identification, risk management and evaluation, risk \\nmonitoring and mitigation as well as accountability, and a clear responsibilities across all three lines of defence but also a culture \\nof ethics, setting out standards of behaviour which we expect our employees to adhere to. Our Code of Conduct is at the heart of \\neverything we do. It is designed to ensure that we conduct ourselves ethically  – with integrity, and in accordance with DWS´s and \\nDeutsche Bank’s policies and procedures as well as the laws and r egulations that apply to us across the world. Underpinning all \\nof this is a simple but basic principle that we should do what is right and proper  – it is not enough to just go by what is allowed. \\nIn addition to integrity standards, our risk management framework shows the importance of an effective Compliance organisation \\nin order to safeguard our regulatory, reputational and operational business interests. Compliance is embedded in this Risk \\nManagement Framework. In this context, it has the task to monitor  and assess DWS’s risk profile with regard to the agreed risk \\nappetites as well as the effectiveness of Level 1 controls that ensure risk mitigation. Although we have adopted a risk \\nmanagement process and regularly review our various controls, procedures, systems and policies, we are aware, that non-\\ncompliance with relevant laws and regulations and an inappropriate control framework could expose DWS to material financial, \\nregulatory and reputational risk. \\nWith the transformation of the former Chief Control Organisation and integration into respective DWS divisions, the DWS \\nCompliance organisation was integrated into the Chief Operating Office. The COO is responsible for Operations, the Divisional \\nControl Office, the Chief Administrative Office, the Platform Transformation Team AFC & Compliance and Legal as well as \\nresponsibility for the US region. \\n[Business Ethics] \\n[GRI 102-17] \\nWe apply a Code of Conduct that sets out the standards of behaviour to which we expect all of our employees to adhere to. The \\nunderlying basis adopted is a DB Group global conduct risk framework designed to avoid the inappropriate creation of bad \\noutcomes for our clients, our firm or the integrity of financial markets through breaches of laws, regulations or internal \\nrequirements such as our Code of Conduct. This global framework defines the principles for oversight over the management of \\nconduct risk so that there is timely identification, reporting, escalation and remediation of issues that arise. \\nSince our IPO in March 2018, we developed a distinct set of values and corporate culture in order to position ourselves for the \\nfuture. Therefore, the Executive Board identified four values shaping the culture of DWS as a leading asset manager. Culture and \\nintegrity are an essential cornerstone of a good corporate governance and success for the future. All asset management \\ncapabilities must be backed by strong and consistent investment performance. With regards to conduct risk management, our \\nemployees are at the heart of what we do working in partnership, building trust and acting with integrity. With regards to \\nreputational risk, our brand is one of the most important assets that our company has. Our brand offers identity, distinguishes the \\ncompany and its products from its competitors, impacts the value of a company and attracts future employees. For additional \\ninformation on composition, choice and governance of our boards and committees, please refer to the ‘Corporate Governance \\nStatement’ within this report. \\nIn 2019, we set out a Culture and Conduct Programme that has continued into 2020. The Culture and Conduct Programme in \\n2020 included 7 initiatives designed to drive the DWS corporate culture. In total these 7 initiatives constitute the DWS Culture \\nPlan. These initiatives are designed to focus on DWS employees since the more employees understand the risk attributable to \\ntheir function, product, and business area, the more likely they are to incorporate them into decision making and ethical \\nbehaviour. In 2020, 5 initiatives from the Culture Plan were fully implemented, 2 initiatives will continue into 2021. \\nDealing with Conflicts of Interest \\nConflicts of interest are inherent to all banking and investment businesses. Failure to recognise and appropriately manage \\nconflicts of interest can result in inappropriate or adverse consequences for clients, DWS Group, and our employees. Every part \\nof DWS Group is required to implement a dedicated framework for conflicts of interest in line with the Conflicts of Interest Polic y –  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nCompliance and Con\\n trol\\n \\n\\n[Business Ethics]\\n  \\n\\n66\\n \\nDWS Group, to identify actual and potential conflicts and manage them fairly and appropriately for all involved parties. Conf licts of \\ninterests are identified and administered through the respective Chief Operating Officers in the first line of defence and \\nCompliance as second line maintains oversight. This includes topics such as employee trading, outside business interests, deal \\nlogging or conflicts arising from family and close personal relationships. \\nAn independent DB Group-wide Business Selection and Conflicts Office (BSCO) is responsible for identifying and managing \\ntransaction related conflicts. It has the mandate to approve or reject business transaction and annually reports to the Executive \\nBoard on conflicts of interest. \\nIn 2020, we further strengthened the governance procedures around conflicts of interest within the Conflicts of Interest Council. \\nProcedures around conflicts of interest were tested through a dedicated Compliance review in 2019 with no significant findings \\naccording to our internal audit rating methodology. \\nAnti-Competitive Behaviour \\n[GRI 206-1] \\nThe consequences of anti-competitive behaviour could be serious and far-reaching. Our Anti-Trust Compliance programme \\ndefines the minimum standards of behaviour for our employees and includes a comprehensive training and control framework for \\nidentifying and monitoring anti-trust risks in order to prevent or mitigate breaches of anti-trust laws.  \\nTo our knowledge, there have been no pending or completed legal actions against DWS Group during the reporting period \\nregarding any anti-competitive behaviour or violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation in which the organisation has been \\nidentified as a participant. \\nIn 2020, efforts around further strengthening our anti-trust framework continued by, among others the continuation of the anti-trust \\nworkshops with DB Group Compliance. \\nMarketing and Labelling \\nOur reputation is founded on trust from our clients, shareholders, regulators, employees and from the public in general. Isolated \\nevents can undermine that trust and negatively impact our reputation and hence our brand and it is therefore very important that it \\nis protected.  \\nOur governance structure including operation guidelines, defined policies and our corporate values provide a structured \\nframework for all employees to protect our brand and reputation. They enable a tight connectivity across the organisation to \\nensure that the framework is being followed and fully implemented. Our values and methodical business process are also \\nreflected in the marketing and labelling of our products.  \\nAll marketing efforts must be tailored to the investors requirements, must be fair, balanced and designed to ensure that risks are \\nreasonably disclosed. Such materials are subject to complex regulatory requirements, which vary depending on the DWS entity, \\nproduct, intended audience, venue where the offer or sale occurs, and other criteria. Our employees not only adhere to these \\nrequirements but also use professional judgment to present product and marketing content with honesty and transparency. \\nAs part of the marketing review process it is required that all marketing and product materials as well as further documents are \\nreviewed and approved by Compliance or respective business gatekeepers to ensure that all requirements are being followed. \\nThe records of all approved materials are either retained by Compliance, the business or within the Compliance review systems. \\nOnly material that has been reviewed and approved can be published or distributed externally to clients. \\nWe follow a clear set of rules including our Code of Conduct and address law-abiding conduct, corruption prevention, conflicts of \\ninterest, information and data protection to protect our clients’ interests as well as our brand and reputation. We also foll ow the \\nstandards of DB Group´s Gifts, Entertainment and Business Event Policy, our global Marketing Material Policy and for some \\nregions additional marketing policies that have been defined based on local requirements.

Failure to identify and manage risks relating to financial crime exposes DWS and its staff to potential corporate criminal \\nand/or regulatory liability, civil lawsuits, financial losses and a loss of reputation. The Executive Board is ultimately responsible for \\nthe management and mitigation of financial crime risks within the Group. It has delegated tasks relating to those obligations to the \\nAnti-Financial Crime (AFC) and Compliance function. This global function maintains a close alignment with the AFC and \\nCompliance function of DB Group. \\nThe goal of the AFC function is to prevent DWS and our clients from being misused, or from engaging in the commission of \\ncertain criminal offences, referred to as financial crime. AFC is a second line of defence control function, managing and mitigating \\nthe financial crime risks assigned to it in the Non-Financial Risk Management taxonomy. These relate to the prevention of money \\nlaundering, countering terrorism financing, and the prevention of other criminal activities (e.g. fraud, bribery and corruption) as \\nwell as to observing sanctions and embargoes. AFC develops and implements, or oversees the development by other areas, \\npolicies, procedures and processes, which form the control framework for those risks. AFC not only has oversight in respect of \\nthe broader control framework as it relates to countering other criminal activities, including controls for which other functions are \\naccountable, but also performs second line of defence controls to detect and prevent financial crimes we are exposed to as well \\nas to identify potential governance and control gaps. Furthermore, AFC provides specific training to our employees and to \\nbusiness development consultants engaged to ensure sufficient knowledge and awareness to support to achieve the AFC \\nfunction’s goal across the whole Group.  \\nEvery employee is responsible for the prevention, detection, and reporting of internal and external fraud as well as of bribery a nd \\nother forms of corruption in connection with the firm’s business. We require all employees to conduct themselves with the hig hest \\nstandards of integrity at all times and to follow the correct procedures if they believe that something is not right. A spe ak-up \\nculture is essential to maintaining a positive compliance culture in which everyone not only adheres to our policies, but als o \\nrespects applicable laws and regulations in all jurisdictions at the same time as offering a safe environment for employees to raise \\nissues.\\n9 Our Anti-Fraud Policy applies to all employees, permanent and temporary, and explains how to immediately escalate any \\nknown or suspected fraudulent incident or any concern, via our whistleblower tool or hotline that protects the identity of the \\nindividuals raising the incident or concern. We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption in line with our Code of \\nConduct, our values and beliefs, and national and international laws and regulations. The Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy sets \\nout the minimum standards of behaviour expected by all employees and third parties as well as the minimum safeguarding \\nmeasures to be implemented. Any non-compliance with the Fraud as well as the Bribery and Corruption Policies will lead to \\nconsequences for the respective individuals. \\nDuring 2020, once again, we as well as external auditors and regulatory authorities did not identify or report any material \\nbreaches of laws and regulatory requirements in relation to fraud, bribery or corruption. \\n[Data Protection and Client Privacy] \\n[GRI 418-1] \\nThe adoption of new technologies, including robotics, public cloud, block chain and big data analytics solutions combined with the \\nproliferation of Financial Technology (FinTech) providers are providing a new wave of innovation for the financial services \\nindustry. While these new technologies are also bringing opportunities to asset managers they are also creating new risks. \\nHistorically, the asset management market has not been the primary focus for cyber- attacks due to the business nature and the \\nfocus of fraudsters on payments. These trends might be changing to more client data and intellectual property (e.g. investmen t \\nstrategies) driven targets, where asset managers could be a potential area for cyber-criminal activities. \\nIn terms of market monitoring and collaboration, we work with regulators and market participants to remain up-to -date in the latest \\ninformation security developments and intelligence sharing with the support of a central service provided by the DB Group Chief \\nSecurity Office (CSO). Proactively sharing relevant indicators of compromise and further intelligence reduce the risk for all \\ninvolved parties. We also collaborate closely with government authorities and peer organisations. Our goal is to protect client data \\nand prevent any material data leakage that would affect our clients during the use of our services. \\n\\n9\\n  Raising Concerns (including Whistleblowing) Policy – DB Group  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nCompliance and Control\\n  \\n\\n[Data Protection and Client Privacy]\\n  \\n\\n68\\n \\nData Privacy and Protection \\nData protection has remained a core focus for us with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in force from May 25, \\n2018.  \\nBrexit \\nWe have ensured that GDPR compliance will be in place depending on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. \\nThe EU and UK reached an agreement (\"deal\") on December 24, 2020, which provisionally came into force on January 1, 2021 \\nuntil 28 February 2021 pending ratification by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. The Agreement provides that , \\nfor a maximum period of six months from its entry into force  – i.e., until June 30, 2021 at the latest (transition period) - and upon \\nthe condition that the UK’s current data protection regime stays in place, all data flows of personal data between stakeholde rs \\nsubject to GDPR and UK organisations will not be considered as transfers to a third country. It is possible that the UK\\'s regulatory \\ndata protection framework will be considered as “adequate” until then, such adequacy decision by the EU commission would \\ncontinue to allow the free movement of data. \\nIn the event that no adequacy decision is taken, such transfers will require appropriate safeguards as well as enforceable data \\nsubject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects, in accordance with Article 46 GDPR. The possible alternative \\nmechanisms may include the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC), which would remain the most flexible and least time-\\nconsuming solution. This also applies to data processing relationships between DWS companies in the European Union and the \\nUK, especially since DB Group Data Privacy (DB GDP) has urgently recommended last year that SCCs should be agreed in view \\nof a threatened no-deal Brexit. \\nHowever, the recent decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Facebook Ireland Ltd. v. Maximillian \\nSchrems case, dated July 16, 2020 (\"Schrems II\") has showed that just relying on these contractual tools alone may not be \\nsufficient. Both the CJEU and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) emphasize that the validity of SCCs will depend on \\nthe use of supplementary measures—such as privacy-enhancing technologies—as an additional safeguard against unauthorized \\ndata access. A flexible, risk-based approach is recommended for this purpose. Soon, DB GDP will give some further guidance \\nhere for DWS, too. \\nGovernance \\nFor data privacy we are leveraging DB Group´s expertise and resources. The DB Group General Data Protection (GDP) \\ndepartment is a specialised and independent function controlling the collection, processing and use of personal data. The GDP \\nteam sends reports directly to the Executive Board and is supported by local data protection officers in the countries we conduct \\nbusiness in. This set-up ensures direct and indirect reporting lines as well as regular exchanges on data protection topics within \\nour centralised and decentralised organisation. In response to the increased controls required to ensure compliance with GDPR \\nprovisions, GDP is being expanded to ensure we have enough personnel to monitor, test, and assess our data privacy and \\nprotection set-up. \\nEducation and Training on GDPR \\nAll our staff have been trained on the implications of GDPR for day-to -day business. In 2020, an updated Data Protection and \\nPrivacy mandatory course was rolled out for our employees across all locations. Various reporting and escalation processes from \\nthe business to GDP have been implemented to ensure that potential data breaches can be assessed and handled in a timely \\nmanner. This approach has also been outlined in a global data protection procedure that has been rolled out as part of the GDPR \\nprogram. \\nData Breaches \\nNo data breaches of systemic relevance were observed in 2020. \\nInformation Security Governance \\nOur COO is the Executive Board member overseeing information security which is managed by the Chief Information Security \\nOfficer (CISO). The CISO is the senior accountable officer for information security who has been empowered to strengthen the \\ncyber security protection and align to the strategic direction set by the CSO from DB Group.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nCompliance and Control\\n  \\n\\n[Public Policy and Regulation]\\n  \\n\\n69\\n \\nAs the most senior authority for security matters, the CISO develops and drives the implementation and execution of the security \\nstrategy and ensures that our assets are appropriately protected. The DWS cyber security program follows a proactive risk-based \\napproach continuously improving the control standards to accommodate the changes in the ‘threat landscape’, the evolution of \\nthe business model and the adoption of innovative technology and process solutions. To support this, we align our information \\nsecurity management system to the latest information security policies defined by DB Group. Our Information Security Framewor k \\nis managed under the DB Group umbrella framework that has been validated by the certification ISO 27001, which was recertified \\nin 2018 (valid until 2021). To address the risk of violation of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information by third \\nparties, we have a multi-layer vendor management program with an oversight by the dedicated DWS Vendor Management team. \\nThis is governed by Third Party Risk Management principles at DB Group level. \\nEmployee Awareness and Training in Information Security \\nAll our employees are trained in information security risk and controls as part of the on boarding process and regularly during \\ntheir employment. The mandatory training includes several threat scenarios for which employees are challenged to select the \\nbest course of action to ensure that information is protected. Training sessions are continuously renewed, tailored and adapted to \\nfollow latest market developments and specific job profiles to ensure that employees are prepared in case of a cyber-threat.  \\nIn addition to the mandatory training, we use the DB Group awareness campaigns following the strategy to fortify the human \\nfirewall. As in the previous year, we continued to roll out the multi-channel awareness campaign to all staff globally, covering a \\nbroad range of information and security topics including the 2020 Information Security Month initiative. In 2020, we also continued \\nthe \"Time to be aware - the target is you\" campaign to help our staff understand common yet significant security threats and their \\nresponsibility and contribution to helping us protect ourselves against such threats.  \\nAs a result of the strategy, in 2020 we have not experienced any relevant data leakages. \\n[Public Policy and Regulation] \\nRegulatory reforms in the EU and internationally expose us and our clients to increasing regulatory requirements. Failure to \\ncomply with laws and regulations applicable to us could result in harm to our reputation, regulatory penalties or fines and a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations. To be compliant with all relevant rules and regulations is of paramount \\nimportance for us. Our aim is to identify new regulations and changes to existing ones at an early stage and to inform the relevant \\nparties in the Group about it. This ensures that necessary changes can be implemented in time, to amend, upgrade or introduce \\nnew policies, procedures, systems and controls as required. \\nSince the risk of changing rules and regulations is inherent to our daily business, we have developed a holistic framework to \\nidentify and implement new or changed regulations using a systematic approach that prioritises significant regulatory risks and \\nallocates clear accountability for the identification, impact assessment and implementation of regulatory changes in order to \\naddress this adequately. \\nThe framework governs how we manage regulatory change risk and helps to build our profile in regulatory interaction in general, \\nso that we engage constructively with regulatory stakeholders. It also ensures informed strategic decision-making and provides \\noversight and control over how key initiatives are implemented, as well as insight for senior management on upcoming issues of \\npublic policy.  \\nIn 2020, Compliance together with, amongst others, Platform Transformation and AFC further enhanced the process around the \\nRegulatory Change Forum – now called Local Regulatory Adherence Forums to combine the disseminate information to our \\nwider organisation. This includes enhanced transparency regarding implementation and project monitoring through \\ndocumentation of the proceedings and resolutions of the meeting.  \\nThe strategy for the implementation of regulatory change projects depends on the impact of the specific regulatory changes an d \\nthe regulation in question. For major regulatory change topics such as BaFin Guidance Note on Sustainability Risk or SRD II \\ncentrally led change management implementation teams are established to determine precise impact per business lines.  \\nCompliance hold monthly Local Regulatory Adherence Forums, in which regulatory compliance contacts from respective regions \\nprovide updates to employees on key items which impact their jurisdictions and which may have extra-territorial impact. The \\nprocess ensures informed strategic decision-making and provides oversight and control over how regulations are implemented. \\nMonthly summary reports on key regulatory initiatives are provided by Compliance.

We believe that the EU Action \\nPlan on Sustainable Finance will play a key role in achieving the goals from the Paris climate agreement. As a member of the \\nBVI\\n11 and the EFAMA\\n12, DWS takes an active role in contributing its experiences and insights in Sustainable Finance throughout \\nthe policy and legislative process.  \\nThe \"ESG Regulatory Governance\" programme, launched in 2019, continued its work in 2020 by focusing on the implementation \\nof the requirements resulting from SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\\n 13), which is effective from March 10, 2021. \\nUnder SFDR, financial market participants and financial advisors must provide transparency in the integration of sustainability \\nrisks and in the consideration of principal adverse impact in their processes. Furthermore, additional sustainability ‐related infor-\\nmation with respect to financial products must be published by financial market participants. DWS worked in 2020 on the update \\nof the pre-contractual documents and periodic reports as well as on the website disclosures on product and legal entity level. \\nSpecifications outlined in the Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) are currently still pending and its implementation will be one \\nof the programme’s focus areas for the upcoming year.  \\nThe programme also analysed the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation\\n 14 and the planned changes in MiFID II\\n 15, UCITS\\n16 \\nand AIFMD\\n17. The Taxonomy Regulation introduces criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as \\nenvironmentally sustainable. Financial market participants will have to describe how and to what extent the investments \\nunderlying the financial product are in environmentally sustainable economic activities. During 2021, we plan to focus on the \\ndevelopment of detailed business requirements and their implementation. \\nIn December 2019, BaFin\\n18 published a Guidance Notice on Dealing with Sustainability Risks\\n 19. This Guidance Notice serves as \\na compendium of non-binding procedures for companies supervised by BaFin. It was analysed as part of the \"ESG Regulatory \\nGovernance\" programme and an impact assessment was conducted. We plan to continue working on the implementation of the \\nBaFin Guidance Notice in 2021. \\n\\n[Internal Audit] \\nInternal Audit provides independent and objective assurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and \\nefficiency of the risk management systems and systems of internal controls.

Internal Audit has been \\ngranted the authority to communicate with the respective chairperson of the Supervisory Board and the Audit & Risk Committee. \\nInternal Audit activities are based on a comprehensive, risk-based audit plan. The audit plan covers the Group’s activities and \\nprocesses, irrespective of whether they are outsourced or not, within three years or ad-hoc as necessary. The three-year audit \\ncycle may not be extended to more than five years.  \\nInternal Audit prepares written reports on each audit with submission to the responsible Senior Management.

The control system comprises the principles, processes and measures to provide assurance \\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Group’s consolidated fin ancial statements for external \\nreporting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \\nIn addition, an internal control system is required for the integrated non-financial group statement and specifically the reporting of \\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) relating to our sustainability strategy. \\nInternal Control System for the Financial Reporting Process \\nInternal Control System Objectives \\nTo mitigate financial reporting risk the internal control system has been established to provide reasonable but not absolute \\nassurance against material misstatements. To support this the Group adopts the following objectives: \\n−Existence: assets and liabilities exist and transactions have occurred.\\n−Completeness: all transactions are recorded, account balances are included in the financial statements.\\n−Valuation: assets, liabilities and transactions are recorded in the financial reports at the appropriate amounts.\\n−Rights, obligations and ownership: rights and obligations are appropriately recorded as assets and liabilities.\\n−Presentation and disclosures: disclosure, presentation and classification of financial reporting is appropriate.\\n−Safeguarding of assets: unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of assets is prevented or detected in a timely manner.\\nThe internal control system covers both the financial reporting process of the entities included in the consolidated financia l \\nstatements and the consolidation process itself. This ensures the consolidated financial statements as a whole are prepared in \\naccordance with applicable rules and provisions. \\nThe internal control system and risk management system as they relate to financial reporting form an integral part of the broader \\nDWS control environment. \\nInternal Control System Organisation \\nThe Group organisational structure facilitates the operation of the internal control system with clear division of roles and \\nresponsibilities to support the financial reporting process and preparation of consolidated financial statements. The operation of \\nthe internal control system primarily involves staff based in the Chief Financial Office (CFO). \\nCFO is responsible for the periodic preparation of the financial statements and operates as an independent control function. The \\ntwo key control functions within CFO that contribute to the internal control system are the Group Controller and Finance Control \\nOversight (FCO). \\nThe Group Controller is responsible for the financials of the Group and its consolidated subsidiaries.  The Controller function sets \\nthe reporting timetables, performs the consolidation, controls and validates the period end results, executes adjustment \\nprocesses, and compiles the Group financial statements. In addition, Product and Regional Finance teams are responsible for \\nreviewing the quality of financial data by performing validation and control, in close contact with business, infrastructure and legal \\nentity management. \\nFCO is responsible for implementation of the financial reporting control framework to minimise financial reporting risk. FCO also \\ncoordinates the evaluation and review of risk and control issues and performs ongoing assessment and monitoring of the \\neffectiveness of the internal control system. \\nFinancial Reporting Controls \\nThe Group operates a large number of controls in relation to the financial reporting and consolidation processes. Some of the key \\ncontrols that support these processes include the following:  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nCompliance and Control\\n  \\n\\nInternal Control System for the Financial and Non\\n -\\n\\nFinancial Reporting Process\\n  \\n\\n72\\n \\n−Consolidation and other period end reporting controls. Controls over consolidation, financial statement disclosure and\\npresentation.\\n−Accounting policy design and implementation. Controls to promote the consistent recording and reporting of business activitie s\\nin accordance with accounting policies.\\n−Balance sheet substantiation. Controls relating to the substantiation of balance sheet accounts to promote the integrity of\\ngeneral ledger account balances based on supporting evidence.\\n−Valuation including the independent price verification process. The group has established the Principal Valuation Control\\nCouncil to ensure adequate controls over valuation processes.\\n−Reconciliation controls, both external and internal. Inter-system reconciliations are performed between relevant systems for all\\ntransactions, positions or relevant parameters.\\n−New product and transaction approval, capture and confirmation. Controls are intended to ensure the completeness and\\naccuracy of recorded transactions as well as appropriate authorisation for new products and transactions.\\n−System access controls. Controls ensure that user access to financial information in the key financial reporting systems is\\ngoverned by a need-to-know principle.\\nMonitoring and Oversight of Internal Control Effectiveness \\nThe effectiveness of the internal control system relating to the financial reporting process is regularly monitored. This includes \\nmonitoring performed by the independent FCO function within CFO and as part of the broader Group financial reporting and non-\\nfinancial risk and control frameworks. This monitoring includes regular forums comprising control representatives, key control \\ntesting procedures to centrally evaluate the operating effectiveness of the control environment and regular reporting of control \\nenvironment metrics to senior management. \\nThese processes are supported by Internal Audit who evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the internal control \\nsystem by performing periodic and ad-hoc risk-based audits.  \\nFinally, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Executive Board provide senior oversight and governance of the financial reporting \\nprocess including sign off of the consolidated financial statements for the Group. \\n[Internal Control System for the Non-Financial Reporting Process ] \\nIn 2020, to support the accurate reporting of material non-financial information the Group has developed a non-fi nancial internal \\ncontrol system, distinct from the internal control system for financial reporting. The objective of the internal control system for the \\nintegrated non-financial group statement is to provide accurate reporting of internally compiled sustainability KPIs, as disclosed in \\nthe ‘Our Strategy - Sustainability Strategy’ section of this report.  \\nFinancial Planning & Analysis within CFO is responsible for the internal control system, providing the AuM and flow data for all \\ninternal and external ESG AuM and flow reporting as well as reporting of KPIs in collaboration with the KPI owners. They are \\nsupported by other CFO functions including FCO who review the design of the control system. Ownership of the KPIs is split \\nacross the following functions: \\n−Responsible Investments: In collaboration with CFO they ensure the accurate monitoring of ESG AuM and flow data on a\\nmonthly basis.\\n−Corporate Governance Center: Track corporate engagement and proxy voting results.\\n−COO: Track DWS Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and co-ordination with DB Group to obtain emissions data where required.\\n−HR: Monitor gender diversity results.\\nOversight of sustainability KPIs is performed through a senior management forum where KPIs are reviewed and scrutinized in th e \\ncontext of business performance and delivery of strategic objectives. \\nThe internal control system comprises key controls that are designed to ensure the accuracy of sustainability KPIs. These key \\ncontrols vary by KPI but reflect the following key principles: \\n−Four eyes review: All internally produced KPIs are subject to four eyes controls with at least two independent parties involved\\nin the review and reporting of KPI data. In addition for all KPIs, the CFO division acts as a second line independent control\\nfunction before any KPIs are disclosed externally.\\n−Data quality: Data quality checks are performed to ensure accurate KPI reporting. Sustainability KPIs involve diverse sources\\nof data and as such appropriate controls are executed to ensure integrity of the underlying data.\\nIn 2021, the internal control system will be further strengthened through additional oversight by the Group Sustainability Council \\n(GSC) and continued embedding of the Group Sustainability Office into ESG governance, controls and processes.

Following the publication of our N on-Financial Report in 2019, we have again taken a comprehensive \\napproach to better define the scope for our integrated non-financial group statement for 2020. We have continued to consider the \\nopinions of our internal stakeholders in addition to enriching our materiality assessment process by broadening the interviewees’ \\nscope to a wider audience in the company.  \\nAdditionally, we have assessed external sources, expanding the range of ESG topics discussed by professional associations and \\nnon-governmental organisations, as well as analysed the activities of our competitors. Once this research had been concluded, \\nwe firstly engaged subject matter experts across the company to confirm the proposed topics. The experts agreed on 27 topics to \\nbe included in a survey which was in a second step, prepared and sent to DWS employees. These were selected to represent a \\ncross-divisional perspective of DWS, including the views of internal and external stakeholders. Participants in the survey were \\nasked to assess the business relevance of the 27 topics to DWS and the potential impact of DWS on these topics. The evaluatio n \\nalso asked to differentiate between potential positive or negative impacts from DWS on a topic. The results showed that 21 of the \\n27 proposed topics are material for 2020 with 8 new topics new compared to 2019. The results also showed an increasing \\nimportance of people and governance topics when compared to the prior year survey potentially as a result of 2020 \\ndevelopments. We mapped the material topics to the aspects according to HGB or respectively to additional matters after we had \\nidentified the material topics. The materiality assessment results were presented in various meetings and acknowledged by the \\nGroup Controller and CFO.  \\nPlease refer to ‘Content of the integrated non -financial group statement according to the HGB within the Summarized \\nManagement Report’ in the chapter ‘About the Report’ for a more elaborate mapping.  \\nIn 2019, we also analysed our impact on the United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The selected SDGs to \\nwhich DWS could have the greatest impact were SDG 8, \"Decent Work and Economic Growth\"; SDG 10, \"Reducing Inequality\" \\nand SDG 13, \"Climate Action\". We have accordingly mapped our 2020 material topics to these top three SDGs.  \\nAt DWS, we aim to create sustainable economic value by pursuing a long term approach and corporate and board governance \\nwas identified as material in the materiality assessment as it constitutes the basis for our activities regarding financial and non-\\nfinancial material topics. In our corporate engagements and proxy voting, we address corporate governance topics with our \\ninvestees. Similarly, we want to ensure good corporate governance at DWS in order to ensure accountability, fairness and \\ntransparency in relationship with all stakeholders. Our business activities are managed with the objective of creating sustainable \\nvalue by putting ESG at the core of everything. \\nFor additional information, the corporate governance describing the structure of rules, practices, and processes used to direct and \\nmanage the Group is available in section 3 ‘Corporate Governance Statement’ of the Annual Report.

Each commitment or membership is \\nevaluated by the responsible person, who decides whether it is important and worthwhile.  \\nAn overview of our memberships and similar commitments can be found in the Appendix  – Stakeholder Management Table. \\n DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nSustainable Finance, ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n75\\n \\nSustainable Finance, ESG Products and Responsible Investing \\nDesigning Products for our Clients  \\n[GRI 102-11] \\nOur financial performance depends particularly on the ability to develop, market and successfully manage new attractive \\ninvestment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovation \\non our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. If our products are \\nunsuitable or inappropriate for our clients or the target market, we could face potential liability towards them.  \\nOur products and investment solutions are designed to meet current and future client needs. We seek to ensure that the product \\nis designed in such a way that its product features (return expectations, liquidity, diversification or hedging benefits) provide value \\nto our clients. We seek to produce transparent, accessible products that are beneficial to the individual without being detrimental \\nto the world at large. \\nESG data is the cornerstone of our ESG analysis. Our ESG Engine allows automated and bespoke screenings for all kind of \\nclients. As it will be explained in the chapter “Responsible Investing and ESG Products”, the information provided by the ESG \\nEngine is available to all of our portfolio managers and analysts. Easily integrating the information into their detailed analysis an d \\nembedding it into the fund management is crucial to design ESG strategies for our clients. Launching dedicated ESG funds that \\ncomply with current regulation e.g. with the requirements according to the new Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation \\n(SFDR\\n20), EU Taxonomy Regulation\\n21 or local authorities enables our clients to fulfil the increasingly stringent standards their \\nown product offering might have to meet. Furthermore, designing our product suite in line and in anticipation of current and future \\nregulatory developments allows us to address client demand and react to a societal shift driven by changed values of investors, \\nespecially regarding climate change and ESG. \\nAt present, a stringent and clear classification of our products is very important as the new Sustainable Finance Disclosure \\nRegulation (SFDR) introduced various disclosure-related requirements for financial market participants and financial advisors at \\nentity, service and product level. It aims to provide more transparency on sustainability within the financial markets in a \\nstandardised way, thus preventing greenwashing and ensuring comparability. The majority of the new disclosure obligations wil l \\nbe applicable as of March 10, 2021. In the course of 2020, also a first product classification based on the regulations as of \\nDecember 31, 2020 has been completed, which will be reviewed once the detailed ESG regulations are finally published. It is \\nexplained in the following in greater detail. Please see our categorisation framework for retail products in EMEA liquid assets as \\nfollows: \\n\\nPlease note that rating exclusions are based on the ESG Database/Responsible Investment Committee decision to exclude issuers with the lowest ratings within the \\nESG Rating Scheme \\n\\n20\\n \\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of November 27, 2019  \\n\\n21 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 18, 2020  \\n DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nSustainable Finance, ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n76\\n \\nESG Integration which was enhanced by rolling out the DWS “Smart Integration” approach  is one response for our actively \\nmanaged liquid funds in EMEA to the regulatory requirements under Art. 6 of the Disclosure Regulation (also referred to as \\n“Basic”). Art. 6 requires DWS to disclose how ESG risks are considered in the investment process. Applying ESG and Smart \\nIntegration allows us to take sustainability risk factors into account in a proven and transparent way, although our traditional \\nproducts do not pursue a dedicated ESG strategy.  \\nBesides traditional products that are compliant with Art.6 SFDR, sustainable products are again divided in two sub-categories. \\nFirst, sustainable products need to fulfil the requirements set by Art.6 as well. Thus it needs to be disclosed how ESG criteria are \\ntaken into account within the investment process. However, the disclosure requirements for sustainable products go beyond this: \\nProducts that fulfil a dedicated ESG approach must comply with Art.8 SFDR (also referred to as “Light Green”), meaning  that \\nDWS has to disclose the ESG approach the strategy fulfils. All DWS dedicated ESG products follow our ESG standards \\n(MESGS) that are depicted in greater detail in the chapter “Responsible Investing and ESG Products”. Thereby, ESG risks are \\nnot only considered but the fund manager also reacts to them within the investment process, e.g. by the application of exclusions. \\nSustainable products that contain an impact character (i.e. by supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals) must be \\ncompliant with Art.9 SFDR (also referred to as “Dark Green”), meaning that it has to be disclosed how impact is achieved. \\nAlthough this is not demanded by regulation, each of DWS´ “Dark Green” products (Art.9 SFDR) also pursues a dedicated ESG \\napproach (Art.8 SFDR), as DWS considers a dedicated ESG approach the basis for an impact-related investment solution. To \\nconclude, our sustainable products can be divided into two categories (Dedicated ESG strategies and impact strategies with a \\ndedicated ESG approach) as explained below. \\n\\nNote: The Smart Integration approach has become effective for all Germany-domiciled actively managed mutual funds on July 1, 2020, SICAV sub-fonds will follow on \\nFebruary 1, 2021.

In addition, for dedicated ESG strategies resp. impact strategies with a dedicated ESG \\napproach also our ESG standards (MESGS) resp. how an impact is achieved by the strategy is described in the investment \\npolicy.  \\nESG Product strategy framework  \\nIn 2020, we have worked on various product initiatives. We have among other initiatives successfully launched and positioned \\nthematic equity strategies and launched new products, which focus on climate technology, carbon reduction, next generation \\n DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nSustainable Finance, ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n77\\n \\ninfrastructure or ESG global equities and ESG Asian equities. Our Passive team successfully positioned two new ESG ETFs and \\nis working on a much larger number for 2021. \\nESG is an important part of the product strategy value chain. The efficient life cycle management of the ESG product suite takes \\ninto account the following needs and requirements: (a) definition of flagship strategies and their reflection of the value proposition, \\n(b) dedicated funds are aligned with the appropriate customer base, size of the asset class, expected flows and the regulator y\\nframework, (c) development of individual product solutions responding to specific investment needs and values in close\\ncollaboration with strategic distributions partners and clients, (d) development of bespoke investment solutions based on specific\\nclient requirements and needs.\\nThe current ESG product strategy developed by the Global ESG Investment Specialists & Solutions team in close cooperation \\nwith the ESG CIO Office, CCD and ID is composed of following four areas: \\n(1) ESG “mirroring” of flagship funds / capabilities\\n\\n−Build a product set up which enables clients to choose between a “traditional” (non ESG dedicated) and “ESG” version of\\nflagships across different assets classes in the liquid space (Active, Passive, Liquid Real Assets); at present we have 15 ES G\\n“mirror” funds across Active Equity, Fixed Income, Multi Asset and Passive compared to 1 3 funds as of end of 2019 (+15%)\\n 22.\\n\\n−Identify any gaps in product range and review existing products to identify those not aligned to a target market.\\n−Increase awareness of differences between both strategies in all attributes of financial and non-financial data.\\n−Offer distribution partners a uniform perception of DWS ESG strategies based on well-known and successful focus and core\\nfunds.\\n−Help clients to find appropriate investment solutions with regards to SFDR and MiFID II requirements as part of EU regulation\\n(EU taxonomy for sustainable activities)\\n(2) Conversion of funds into ESG funds\\n−Create potential ESG flagships by converting “traditional” (non ESG dedicated) into dedicated ESG strategies.\\n−Fill ESG product gaps in order to satisfy key client demand and improve fund characteristics and profile.\\n−Focus on assets retention and related revenues by redesigning and repositioning of funds with large asset base but small and\\nlimited growth potential.\\n−Strengthen differentiation of various strategies to diversify the product suite and to reduce overlaps.\\n−Offer distribution partners a uniform perception of DWS ESG strategies based on well-known and successful investment\\ncapacities.\\n−Help clients to find appropriate investment solutions with regards to SFDR and MiFID II requirements as part of EU regulation\\n(EU taxonomy for sustainable activities)\\n(3) Innovation and “Next Level ESG”\\n−Create potential ESG flagships by launching innovative and first-mover strategies with a clear differentiation to the market and\\nbased on cutting-edge ESG data provided by our proprietary DWS ESG Engine.\\n−Investment solutions with superior ESG approach, great performance potential, high match to (ESG) market trends and client\\ndemand.\\n−Investment solutions that are unique and offer innovative solutions can be found the impact / positive contributions space\\n(Sustainable Development Goals, green bonds) or in the climate / carbon related area (low carbon, climate transition, physica l\\nclimate risk, stranded assets, climate resilience bonds, water risk)\\n−Fill ESG product gaps in order to cater key client demand and needs.\\n−Offer distribution partners a uniform perception of DWS ESG strategies based on well-known and successful investment\\ncapacities.\\n−Help clients to find appropriate investment solutions with regards to SFDR and MiFID II requirements as part of EU regulation\\n(EU taxonomy for sustainable activities).\\n(4) Bespoke solutions\\n−As a strong ESG proposition can create value for our clients we provide a versatile framework for understanding the key ways\\nit can do so; the framework is based on our modular advisory process using our proprietary ESG Engine and capabilities to\\ndevelopment bespoke ESG investment solutions mainly for institutional clients\\n−To make sustainable investing possible we require maximum transparency from our clients with regard to all relevant risks and\\nopportunities along the entire investment value chain and across all asset classes.\\n\\n22\\n \\nPlease note that in the NFR 2019 18 mirror strategies have been reported.

We have created this framework to manage the \\nrisks associated with the implementation of new products and services, changes in products and services during their life cycles, \\nand, the process by which they are systematically reviewed, to ensure they remain fit for purpose and consistent with the needs, \\ncharacteristics and objectives of their intended market(s) throughout their lifespan. Applicable across all and regions divisions, the \\nrespective processes cover different stages of the product life cycle review, with the NPA process focussing on pre-\\nimplementation and the SPR process on periodic reviews, post implementation. \\nFor the due diligence on environmental, social or corporate governance risks of dedicated ESG products, the new global ESG \\ninvestment specialist team within the Product Division provides a sign-off. This dedicated team was set up in 2020 when product \\nrelated resources were aligned into a newly created Product Division, while prior to that, ESG investment specialists were part of \\nthe entire traditional investment specialists team. Although sustainable investing is becoming the norm across the active, passive \\nand alternative spaces, some asset classes are still more readily associated with ESG than others. In 2020, as in previous years, \\nESG data has been used much more frequently for equities than for fixed income. New funds launched have been “DWS Invest \\nESG Next Generation Infrastructure” or “DWS Invest Qi Global Equity” (will be renamed to “DWS Invest Global Climate Action” in \\n2021). \\n\\nProduct Design and ESG opportunities  \\nWe believe that our investment platform is well-positioned to address market trends. As outlined in the sub- chapter “Product \\nstrategy framework”, global industry tren ds are thoroughly analysed by the different regional Client and Product Strategy teams. \\nThis provides our product functions with a strong knowledge of how to best position our product offerings.  \\nAs a result of demographic shifts over the recent years, ‘ba by-boomers’ and ‘millennials’ form an increasingly important client \\ngroup for us. With the baby boomer generation approaching retirement, we are seeing greater demand for sophisticated \\nretirement solutions, which has triggered growth in outcome-oriented products such as multi asset. We aim to provide innovative \\nsolutions to address these retirement needs and old age provisioning, and we are also leveraging our expertise in customising \\npension products to develop the next generation of retirement solutions.  \\nTo meet the preferred investment demand of the millennial generation, we have also been further developing our digital solutions. \\nWe have enhanced our range of thematic funds to target new growth opportunities from this younger investor group, e.g. throug h \\nthe launch of the DWS ESG Next Generation Infrastructure fund. This strategy invests in liquid infrastructure and real estate \\nassets that are necessary to connect and advance the world while pioneering sustainability standards. \\nNew growth opportunities in the field of ESG may also arise in the fields of thematic or climate-related ESG strategies, \\n\\nThe potential of thematic ESG strategies is depicted in greater detail by the example of investing in the “Blue Economy”. The  \\nDWS Blue Economy\\n23 fund strategy that we started to develop in 2020 and will further work on in 2021 could aim to help trigger \\nsocial and economic benefits by restoring, protecting and maintaining diverse, productive and resilient water ecosystems by \\ncontributing to the achievements of SDG 14\\n 24 and by applying the Blue Economy Financing Principles (United Nations´ Blue \\nEconomy Financing Principles)\\n25 (“Financing Principles”).  \\n\\nThe fund could invest in “ESG leaders” (assessed by our ESG Engine) contributing to the conservation  and/or sustainable use of \\nthe oceans and marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, the strategy is going beyond traditional stewardship by pursuing a \\n\\n23\\n Blue Economy refers to economic sectors which have a direct or indirect link to sea or fresh  water. It especially consists of companies triggering benefits for generations ahead by restoring, \\nprotecting or maintaining diverse, productive and resilient marine ecosystems or the availability of clean water and sanitati on. The Blue Economy investment theme focuses on firms e.g. \\nmitigating ocean acidification, reducing marine pollution, conserving and sustaining marine resources & ecosystems usage, sus tainable fishery. \\n\\n24Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development  \\n\\n251.

With a focused engagement strategy, that is still under development,  we aim to accelerate the \\ntransformation of selected industries and companies that just started their journey to become leaders in the area. To provide the \\nscientific background on sectoral transition pathways in line with the UNEP FI Blue Economy Finance Principles, the SDGs a nd \\nother relevant frameworks, DWS could enter into a product partnership with a well-known NGO, a key thought leader and driver \\nof the development of the Blue Economy Financing Principles.  \\nApplying SDGs, the Financing Principles, economic activities as well as certain investment requirements could give a guidance \\nhow to select investable industries/ sectors. This might include, e.g.: \\n−Exploiting resources: fisheries, aquaculture, minerals, mining, extraction, etc.\\n−Impacting and polluting the oceans  (land based): agriculture, materials / plastics, etc.\\n−Using the oceans: shipping (cargo, cruise ship and leisure, ferries), ports’ operations, energy generation, energy transmission\\n(electricity, pipelines), de-salination, tourism, etc.\\n−Solution providers: machinery & engineering (scrubbers, etc.), rehabilitation of marine resources, circular economy, pollution\\nprevention or rehabilitation, etc.\\n−Climate related aspects: renewable energy etc.\\nPrior to launch, that is planned for end of March 2021, and in context with ongoing sales efforts, various information and \\nmarketing material will be developed explaining the Blue Economy fund strategy and impact. \\nAs mentioned earlier, another interesting area for new and innovative product developments is climate-related investing: Climate \\nchange is a current and omni-present topic globally. The world is changing and so are investors and companies. In line with the \\nsocietal shift towards a more environmentally- friendly and especially climate-friendly behaviour, DWS sees clima te-related \\naspects at the core of its ESG product strategy.  \\nWithin 2020, our ESG Engine Team has introduced a new water risk and opportunity score (WROS) enhancing our climate-  and \\ntransition risk and opportunity rating (CTRR). This enables us not only to come up with additional impact-related strategies \\nintroducing new investment solutions going forward. It also allows us to reflect risks and opportunities related to climate change \\n(in terms of carbon risks and opportunities and also water risks and opportunities) directly in the investment process of our \\nproducts. A brief description of the new investment signal can be found in the chapter  ‘Responsible Investing and ESG Products’. \\nAlso our current and planned product range reflects the importance of the topic “Climate” for our product strategy. Besides the \\nestablished product “DWS Invest ESG Climate Tech”, which invests in climate solution pro viders adapting to or mitigating \\nconsequences of climate change, DWS has launched the n ew “DWS Qi Global Equity” fund (will be renamed to “DWS Qi Global \\nClimate Action” in 2021) as explained in the sub -chapter “New Product Approval and Systematic Product Review”. Compared to \\nthe broad market, the strategy aims to reduce carbon-intensity, whi le improving the portfolio’s resilience against Climate \\nTransition Risk. Decarbonisation is achieved by selecting lower carbon stocks in the respective sectors rather than by \\nsystematically underweighting carbon-intensive sectors. This aims to ensure broad diversification across all sectors, while \\nreducing carbon emissions. In the future, DWS sees additional climate-related investment potential, i.e. in the area of net-zero \\nstrategies or bespoke client solutions for institutional clients. \\nResponsible Investing and ESG Products \\nFiduciary Responsibility \\nThe asset management industry plays an increasingly important role in society, including making the financial system more \\nsustainable. In 2020 ESG has developed strongly, becoming more than part of the Zeitgeist. For asset managers this means \\nintegrating ESG and long-term-sustainability topics such as climate risk into investment strategy, risk management, asset \\nallocation, governance and investment stewardship activities (refer to ‘Risk Report’ for further inf ormation). Financial regulators \\naround the world are to a greater extent focusing on financial institutions\\' capabilities, preparation and actions to manage climate \\nchange and other material sustainability risks and providing sufficient disclosure to investors and clients.  \\nOn November 18, 2020, DWS hosted its second AGM of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA and our Chief Executive Officer has \\nemphasized not only making “sustainability a core component of its fiduciary action”\\n 26\\n but also to introduce and implement an \\nESG strategy that enables us to embed sustainability into our corporate DNA. This includes our commitment to becoming climate-\\nneutral in our actions – in line with the Paris Agreement – and well ahead of the timeline officially set out in the Agreement. We do \\nso not only because our clients, for whom we work in a fiduciary capacity, expect this from us but also because we believe this \\nenhances risk-adjusted returns. We will further strengthen our ESG integration efforts in every part of our investment process and \\n\\n26\\n The speech of our CEO can be found here for additional information: https://download.dws.com/download?elib-\\nassetguid=05507313a50e41a2b0dace3b58357ce8&publishLocationGuid=eacbc9cf4b8e4d2189eb69cd09e2ff4f&wt_eid=2158773270700125389&wt_t=1606721726824   DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , E\\nSG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n80\\n \\nin anticipation of Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) to also focus on principal adverse impacts (PAI). Putting \\nESG at the core of our fiduciary actions goes beyond our own investment decisions but also by intensifying active ownership of \\nour holdings, extending proxy voting and engagement activities to drive change for the benefit of our investments and our clients. \\nIn order to assume our fiduciary duty, DWS continues to rely on the activities of the CIO Office for Responsible Investments. The \\nteams’ tasks and mandates consist of developing structures, processes and data for integrating ESG considerations in the \\nInvestment Division spanning across Active, Passive and Alternatives. This generates awareness and knowledge among analysts \\nand portfolio managers and is responsible for creating engagement opportunities assuming our investment stewardship role. We \\naim to continuously enhance the level of ESG integration across our entire Active and Alternatives investment platforms and t o \\nincrease the number of dedicated ESG mutual fund strategies with our DWS ESG investment standard. For our Passive \\nbusiness, we underlined investment stewardship for example through the exercise of proxy voting obligations or by tilting their \\nportfolios towards climate-linked investments as a key differentiator with a second survey conducted in collaboration with \\nCREATE-Research\\n 27. \\n\\nIn order to manage DWS’s exposure to poorly ESG rated securities in actively managed strategies, DWS has implemented its \\nannounced process called “smart integration” underpinned by a Committee for Responsible Investments. In 2020, we have \\nformalized this approach in order to manage sustainability risks and in order to conduct an enhanced due diligence on poorly \\nrated corporate and sovereign issuers. \\nPolicies \\n\\nFurthermore, we are subject to several internal policies, such as our revised publicly available \"Responsible Investment \\nStatement (RI)”\\n28\\n , our \"Policy on Controversial Conventional Weapons\"\\n 29 or our updated \"ESG Integration Policy for Active \\nInvestment Management\"\\n30 as well as our “Engagement Policy”\\n 31\\n. Externally, we comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act by \\nsigning the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement\\n 32 through DB Group. We publish our most relevant commitments \\nand policies on our dws.com website. We update our policies and procedures on a regular basis in accordance with our review \\ncycle. Our fund prospectuses for our Xtrackers platform became effective in the first half of 2020 and since then exclude \\nmanufacturers of controversial conventional weapons as identified by our policy. DWS has further reacted by intensifying \\nengagements with various companies from the military defence sector which are documented to be involved in manufacturing or \\nsale of nuclear weapons or depleted uranium weapons. We took this step in anticipation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of \\nNuclear Weapons, which is expected to become effective in January 2021.\\n\\nCommitments \\nInternational standards such as the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Corporations, Oslo-based Cluster \\nMunitions Convention and Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) are guiding principles for our \\nbusiness. Going forward, DWS will work towards its publicly communicated goal of becoming climate-neutral in its actions  – in \\nline with the Paris Agreement –well ahead of the timeline officially set out in the Paris Agreement. In addition, DWS has made a \\ncommitment through the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative. The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative will be managed globally by \\nsix Founding Partner investor networks, namely: Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC), CDP, Ceres, Investor Group \\non Climate Change (IGCC), Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Principles for Responsible Investment \\n(PRI). The initiative is also endorsed by The Investor Agenda, of which the investor networks are all founding partners. DWS has \\nalready set up a project to implement implications among others on the Investment Division during 2021 and beyond. \\nDWS continues to assume its responsibility as one of the early signatories of the United Nations-backed Principles for \\nResponsible Investment (PRI) in 2008. We believe that our expertise and lengthy experience in sustainable investing provide \\nvaluable insights that assist us to further protect and grow our clients’ assets over the long term. The CIO Office for Respo nsible \\nInvestments works along the six principles of the PRI and aims at contributing to each of them. In addition to what is mentioned \\nunder the section ‘Responsibility around our Fiduciary Value Chain –  Stakeholder Management’, DWS places particular \\nimportance collaborating with the PRI, examples include among others: \\n−Presentation at PRI-hosted events on ESG and strategic asset allocation in October 2020\\n−A DWS employee is the chair of the PRI securitized products advisory committee\\n−A DWS employee is part of the PRI sub-sovereign debt advisory committee\\n\\n27\\n We note that due to the nature of the business the opportunities to integrate ESG in passive are restricted to stewardship (proxy voting and active ownership).

Further, DWS continues to support CEO climate letter to \\nEuropean heads of state and heads of government. DWS is among the few asset managers to have continuously signed a similar \\nletter since 2009 from investors to governments that calls for stronger climate change policies. \\nResponsible Investing Governance \\nThe CIO for Responsible Investments covers the investment platform for liquid (Active and Passive in listed securities including \\nLiquid Real Assets) and illiquid (direct real estate, infrastructure and sustainable investments) assets. The area is organized \\nacross 5 responsibilities: ESG Thematic Research, Responsible Investment Center , ESG Engine and Solutions team, \\nCorporate Governance Center and ESG integration for Active. The entire CIO Office for Responsible Investments supports \\nour ESG integration activities, our ESG investment solutions, and product offering. The Corporate Governance Center also \\nenables active ownership (the exercise of proxy voting and governance engagement). Complementing these activities, we also \\nhave ESG specialist investment professionals embedded across DWS supporting our ESG activities. This includes an ESG \\nGatekeeper in every major investment team of the Active platform, senior ESG portfolio managers as well as our dedicated \\nSustainable Investments team within the Alternatives product line. Within Alternatives, we also manage real estate investments in \\ncertified green-labelled buildings or sustainability theme d infrastructure. In 2020, DWS’s CIO for Responsible Investments has \\nbeen appointed as a member of the Sustainable Finance Committee of the German Federal Government. The CIO for \\nResponsible Investments is also a member of the DWS Group Sustainability Council, which held its inaugural meeting on \\nDecember 16, 2020. Further, the function chairs the Committee for Responsible Investments. Lastly, the CIO for Responsible \\nInvestments is a member of the “Ausschuss Nachhaltigkeit” of German BVI Bundesverband Invest ment und Asset Management \\ne.V. (BVI) .With the announcement of DWS’s ESG Advisory Board in December 2020, the Investment Division expects further\\ncollaboration options and an outside-in perspective on the acceleration of its ESG strategy, responsible investing and sustainable\\nfinance.\\nThe entire CIO Office for Responsible Investments acts as an entry point for investment-related questions stemming from \\ninvestors (ESG investment related at DWS AGM), (including Deutsche Bank) clients or other stakeholders such as NGOs or \\n(potential) external partners. \\nESG Thematic Research \\n\\nESG Thematic Research is part of the DWS Research Institute, reporting to the Head of the Research House - a direct report to \\nthe head of Investment Division. The DWS Research Institute is responsible for producing research on themes that will affect \\ninvestments in the next decade and the long view. The team is a key channel for delivering all research produced in the inves t-\\nment teams outside the CIO Office. The ESG Thematic Research team retains close links with the CIO Office for Responsible \\nInvestments. The area’s research activity has centered on research publications, representing DWS in industry workshops, \\npresentations, summits and webinars.

The function also prepares mandatory \\nreporting for DWS Annual Report, Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) and informs internal and external stakeholders of \\nour ESG activities. The function also engages with NGOs through our Communications department, other external parties, \\ncoordinates internal ESG-related policies and global memberships and projects within DWS and contributes to industry \\nconsultations by German BVI for example on the proposed requirements imposed by the EU Ecolabel. Together with the CIO for \\nResponsible Investments, the Responsible Investment Center also owns the taxonomy for labelling DWS products and strategies \\nas ESG and classifying the underlying approach. Throughout 2020, the area has collaborated on regulatory requirements arising \\nfrom SFDR. During 2020, the Responsible Investment Center participated in various client events and exchanges with regulatory \\nbodies and the team has acted as a subject matter expert in DWS ESG reputational risk assessments in several cases, when \\nrequired by virtue of DWS’s internal operating procedures (see Risk Report –  Non-Financial Risk for further information).Together \\nwith the Head of Non-Financial Risk, the Responsible Investment Center worked on possible proof points for reputational risks \\nfrom ESG – if applicable with the help of the ESG Engine subject to data availability. \\nTogether with the CIO for Responsible Investments, the Responsible Investment Center drove major changes for the investment \\nplatform through the introduction of “Smart Integration”  underpinned by a Committee for Responsible Investments (CRI). \\nUnderlying processes are for example being the key contact for investment guideline management teams, minute-keeping and \\nrecord-retention and drafting of engagement letters arising from Committee analyses.  \\nESG Engine and Solutions \\n\\nESG Engine and Solutions drove major initiatives for improving our proprietary ESG database, responsible for ESG methodology, \\nalgorithms, and data. In 2020, the use of external ESG data vendors has been streamlined to five providers: ISS-ESG, MSCI \\nESG, Morningstar Sustainalytics, S&P TruCost and Arabesque S-Ray. They provide data to enable ESG analysis as part of the \\ninvestment process. The structured ESG information is embedded within our portfolio management tool Aladdin and is available \\nfor all liquid asset classes to support ESG integration for our portfolios and to manage dedicated ESG strategies. For certai n \\ntypes of asset classes we are working to overcome known challenges\\n 37 to remediate gaps for example with the onboarding of \\nArabesque S-Ray or through second party opinions on green bonds. We have also prepared the use of sustainability indicators \\nas required under SFDR and integrated ESG data to approximate principal adverse impacts (PAI) on sustainability factors .  \\n\\nIn 2020, we enhanced and implemented our ESG KPIs (EKPIs), which we publish on the DWS’s website for dedicated ESG retail \\nstrategies. We have also developed a methodology, which considers water risks and opportunities and in November 2020 this \\nnew score also became part of our ESG investment standards (MESGS). We have done so by adding water risks and \\nopportunities as an additional pillar in our climate and transition risk (CTRR) score. This will be explained in additional detail in the \\nsection ‘Contribution to Action on Climate Change’ and ‘Human Rights and Norm Assessment in the Investment Process’, \\nrespectively. The ESG Engine and Solutions team has developed a total carbon intensity score which approximates an \\naggregated carbon footprint, also integrating avoided emissions based on third party data, to be used for client reporting and \\nproduct development. \\nWhile the ESG Engine continues to be the building block for our Active analysts and portfolio managers to integrate financially \\nmaterial ESG information in their investment decisions, it is also the foundation of dedicated ESG strategies using our ESG \\ninvestment standards (see section ‘ESG Product Design’), for passively managed strategies and for Liquid Real Assets (LRA).  \\n\\n35\\n Please see for additional details:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noS1BfV2KVE&feature=youtu.be  \\n\\n36 For additional details: : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peA1cXQa9eI \\n\\n37 As expected, ESG data availability for e.g. United States municipal bonds, high-yield bonds, small-cap issuers or emerging market issuers is more heterogeneous resulting in lower coverage \\nfor portfolios pursuing these strategies  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n83\\n \\nCorporate Governance Center  \\nThe Corporate Governance Center has actively contributed to various working groups and industry initiatives with the aim of \\nshaping global corporate governance developments, representing the best interests of our clients (please refer to section \\n‘Responsibility around our Fiduciary Value Chain – Stakeholder Management’ for more details).  \\nIn Germany, we participated in the consultation on changes to the German Corporate Governance Code and the transposition of \\nSRD II into national law (ARUG II). As a member of the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management \\n(Deutsche Vereinigung für Finanzanalyse und Asset Management e.V., DVFA) we continue to promote the DVFA Scorecard on \\nCorporate Governance as a measure of governance quality for German companies. We have co-developed the DVFA \\nStewardship Guidelines for Germany that provide guidance also for German Asset Managers on the implementation of \\nStewardship. In their capacity as active member of the DVFA-commission Governance & Stewardship, a member of the \\nCorporate Governance Center also initiated discussions with the German regulator, Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungs-\\naufsicht (BaFin), on the topic of collaborative engagement. These discussions were complemented by regular discussions with \\nrepresentatives from the PRI on the regulatory hurdles associated with this topic. Furthermore, the DVFA-commission held an \\nexpert round table in February 2020 to discuss the DVFA-Stewardship Guidelines that were well received by practitioners, asset \\nowners, auditors and academic experts. In addition, the DVFA-commission Governance & Stewardship held a hybrid conference \\non Purpose, Sustainability and Stewardship that was organized largely by a member of the DWS Corporate Governance Center. \\nWe have also contributed to the discussions within the German Investment Fund Association (Bundesverband Investment und \\nAsset Management, BVI) on the implementation of the 2 nd Shareholder Rights Directive (SRDII) the transposition of SRD II into \\nnational law in Germany, the annual review of the guidelines on analysing German AGM-agendas and additional consultations, \\ni.e. the EC-consultations on Sustainable Corporate Governance, the Sustainable Finance Strategy of the European Commission\\nand the consultation by Deutsche Börse/Stoxx on the criteria for listings in German DAX-indices.\\nIn 2020, in light of the COVID-19-pandemic, the German government allowed listed companies to hold the virtual AGMs and to \\nlimit shareholders’ questions, meeting participation, filing of resolutions and appeals against motions. As a responsible inv estor, \\nDWS acknowledged the necessity for such emergency legislation, however, we expressed our concerns about the possibility to \\nextend these measures for the full year 2021 early on in position papers by the DVFA and the BVI. We also developed and \\npresented proposals on how the shortcomings could be overcome in the future and invited other trade associations for \\ndiscussions. In Q3, pressure from CEOs of 60 listed companies lead to a prolonging of the aforementioned measures. In \\ncorporation with DVFA commission, we started to engage actively with legislators from the German parliament (Bundestag) and \\nthe Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection to initiate changes to the legislation that would restore at least some of the \\nshareholder rights. This process is ongoing. \\nAs a member of the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA), we have actively participated in the \\ndiscussions around the development of a new European Union (EU) Regulation on Sustainable Finance contributing with our \\nexperience as investors in terms of responsible investing and engagements with portfolio companies. We are furthermore \\nparticipating in working groups of the UK-fund industry association, the Investment Association (IA), in light of the revised UK \\nStewardship Code reporting requirements and are providing regular feedback to the UK-regulator, the Financial Reporting \\nCouncil (FRC). The Stewardship Code submission is due to the FRC by March 31, 2021. Following receipt of submissions, the \\nFRC will then review and allocate a Tier status to each. We have been able to submit a draft response to the FRC for early \\nfeedback on the stewardship principles from an investor angle. A member of our Corporate Governance Center has become a \\nboard member of the Stewardship Committee of “The Investment Association” (IA). The Stewardship Committee is a high -level \\ncommittee of the IA and reports directly into the Board of the IA. We regard this as an opportunity to increase DWS’s visibility and \\ninvolvement in the UK-specific discussion about the future of stewardship, regulatory developments in this field and the \\nimplications for us as asset management industry. We are fully supportive of this effort by the FRC to bring greater transparency \\nto Stewardship globally and believe the Code will be of considerable use to our clients and prospects.\\nGlobally, we have continued our active participation in the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk and Sustainability. \\nAdditionally, we started to participate in the Ceres Investor Water Hub, a working group that aims to drive greater consideration of \\nwater investment decision-making by assessing water risks and opportunities.  \\nWe are also participating in the consultation involving the changes to the Global Governance Principles (GGPs) as a member of \\nthe International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) with the aim to promote effective standards of corporate governance \\nacross all global companies. \\nThe Corporate Governance Center continued to share important insights with our clients on the relevance of investment \\nstewardship and various other topics including investors’ expectations on executive remuneration  following the implementation of \\nSRD II. We also participated in various conferences as speakers and panelists and recorded a podcast on the importance of \\ngovernance for sustainable investing including in BrightTALK-sessions. To that extent and having in mind that the global \\neconomic impact of COVID-19 clearly demonstrated the interconnectedness of human and economic health, a member of our  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n84\\n \\nCorporate Governance Center published her view on the necessity for investors not to lose their focus and bring climate \\nstewardship to a higher level with their dialogues with companies to avoid a next big crisis caused by climate change (for \\nadditional details, see the investment insight published on our website  – \"Taking Climate Stewardship to the Next Level\" ). \\n\\nESG Integration for Active \\nDWS is convinced that putting ESG at the core of our fiduciary actions implies embedding ESG in the investment process more \\nfirmly. It is important that in addition to aligning our clients’ investments with their personal values, striving to improve  risk-\\nadjusted returns or diversifying their portfolios, we can also help them to achieve a positive environmental or social contribution. \\nOur RI Statement guides our approach to ESG topics. Financially material ESG topics and global trends are integrated into our \\ninvestment processes in all asset classes across our Active investment decisions and we support the growth of dedicated ESG \\nproducts and solutions. In our view, integrating environmental, social, and corporate governance factors into the investment \\nprocess contributes to a better understanding of businesses and the issuer environments. It enables us to identify the risks and \\nopportunities that a traditional financial analysis would miss, or fail to systematically address, with potentially significant impact on \\nlong-term investment performance. Our target is to increase the integration of ESG at all relevant steps of the Active investment \\nprocess depicted below.  \\nWe understand ESG integration as a complement to traditional fundamental analysis, which adds value to the quality of our \\ninvestment decision and offers opportunities for higher risk-adjusted returns. DWS has emphasized its commitment to ESG \\nintegration by increases resources during 2020. The team also contributed to consultations and discussions in Schmalenbach, \\nBVI as well as EFFAS.  \\nWe aim to continuously enhance the level of ESG integration across our entire investment platform and continuously update our \\nESG Engine, and methodologies for comprehensive analysis of ESG information. The ESG methodology is governed by the \\nESG Methodology Panel (EMP), with representatives from different asset classes and research. The methodology is continuously \\nenhanced and the ESG Engine is reviewed regularly by the functional participants within the EMP. \\nAt the start of 2020, DWS had initiatives and measures under way to prepare the Investment Division for upcoming requirements \\nstemming from SFDR. During 2020, we have further intensified ESG integration across the Active investment process with the \\nfollowing improvements:  \\n−Guidelines: We tightened our internal ESG Integration Policy for Active portfolio managers as well as formalized our ESG\\nintegration in our fund prospectuses and investment management agreements for our European domiciled strategies in order\\nto be prepared for SFDR. We have also made smart integration mandatory for Germany-domiciled actively managed mutual\\nfunds and established an operational framework around this process.\\n−CIO View: We expanded our analysis of material ESG global trends into our CIO View, in Q2 we focused on Norms/Climate\\nTransition Risk Ratings (CTRR) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with implications for sector allocation and year-\\nto-date performance. In Q3 we focused on CTRR/carbon/water implications for sector allocation and year-to -date\\nperformance. We regard these contributions as ESG integration into the strategic sector allocation.\\n DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n85\\n \\n−Training: In 2020 we have continued to engage investment professionals for ESG integration through 16 global training\\nsessions on how to use ESG ratings within the ESG Engine. In addition the team focused on ESG integration for sovereigns\\nand quasi-sovereigns through a further 9 training sessions in total including the roll-out and use of smart integration for\\nsovereign analysts. We have conducted 2 ESG Gatekeeper meetings and 6 training sessions on how analysts and fund\\nmanagers should use the newly developed engagement database. We held 7 sector materiality workshops to further assist\\ninvestment professionals in their day-to -day ESG integration with an initial focus on financial materiality with a plan to continue\\nwith more workshops during 2021. Since 2017, DWS employees have been supported to register for the EFFAS ESG exam\\nfor certification. Overall additional employees qualified as certified ESG analysts in 2020 (please refer to the chapter\\n‘Employees and Workplace’ for further details). We will continue with these training sessions in 2021, with a focus on a furt her\\nroll-out of sector materiality workshops and consideration of principal adverse impacts in the investment decision.\\n−Research: We have further enhanced our research handbooks and started tracking of ESG integration in our internal research\\nnotes. For more details, please refer to the section ‘Research and Strategy related portfolio construction’.\\n−Portfolio management: Our investment professionals are expected to be aware of any exposure to critical ESG issues and\\nact accordingly. Exposure to ESG laggards (“E” or “F” rated companies) is part of reviews within regular performance and risk\\nreview meetings. During 2020 this awareness has been further enhanced with our “smart integration” strategy and Committee\\nfor Responsible Investments process (see below). From 2020 onwards, the CRI requires an additional level of due diligence\\nwhich constitutes a binding requirement for in-scope mutual funds.\\n−Engagement: DWS updated its Engagement Policy in 2020 to consider financial and non-financial issues such as poor ESG\\nprofiles measured by, for example, CTRR and (non-)compliance with international norms. We have also developed and\\nimplemented an internal engagement database to track engagements on financial- and non-financial topics and held several\\ncourses to introduce the engagement policy and the functionality of the new engagement database\\n−Monitoring: We have started to develop an ESG integration framework and reporting process in order to track progress on our\\nESG integration activities.\\n−Client reporting: We rolled out our EKPI report on our website for DWS ESG Retail funds and have also extended ESG\\nreporting to include a performance attribution based on the violation of international norms and our Climate and Transition Risk\\nRating. This EKPI report is now publicly available for all DWS-labelled ESG funds on the respective DWS websites.\\n−Fund treasury and investment guideline compliance : DWS’s Fund Treasury teams continue to restrict the allocation of\\ncash balances to counterparty banks deemed ESG compliant from an ESG Engine assessment. Our Investment Compliance\\nteams check for eligibility from an ESG perspective including compliance with ESG investment standards or compliance with\\ncontroversial conventional weapons policy. Maintaining conformity in our dedicated ESG mutual funds or ESG investment\\nguidelines for our institutional clients is assured by ESG specification sheets, which are executed by Investment Guideline\\nCodings. For all actively managed portfolios, our general exclusion policy applies for issuers associated with manufacturing or\\nproliferation of controversial conventional weapons.\\nSmart Integration: managing sustainability risks through our Committee for Responsible Investments \\nThe strategic goal of DWS’s ESG smart integration has been to effectively identify and manage risks from environmental, socia l \\nor corporate governance (ESG) factors. In December 2019, the Executive Board approved a proposal for an enhanced \\ninvestment process known as “Smart Integration of ESG”. DWS has deliberately decided against implementing top -down sector-\\nbased exclusions and has introduced enhanced level due diligence, when there is evidence that issuers face excessive climate \\nand transition risks or severe and confirmed violations of international norms. On 1 st July 2020, DWS formalized this approach \\nwith the effective date of fund prospectuses of German domiciled mutual funds. This approach prohibits investments in these \\ncorporates and sovereigns in these mutual funds, unless the Committee for Responsible Investments (CRI) performs a due \\ndiligence and waives the investment restrictions conditional upon action items such as intensified engagement or restricts new \\ninvestments in these issuers. This due diligence process can also lead to a potential exclusion from the investment universe \\nwhen there is evidence of severe sustainability risks or non-responsiveness from issuers on engagement. Starting in the fourth \\nquarter 2020, the Committee has been focussing on water risk and opportunities (as part of Climate and Transition Risk Ratings) \\nand severe climate- and transition risks for investments in sovereign bonds. Additional Luxembourg-domiciled mutual funds will \\nsequentially adopt the new smart integration wording in their respective fund prospectuses. As of December 31, 2020, 52 \\nGermany domiciled mutual funds with AuM of € 60 billion were subject to the new smart integration approach. We exp ect number \\nof funds and AuM covered to more than double in the first half of 2021.\\nIssuers, which receive a waiver for ongoing investment during the process should be engaged with. F-rated (by Climate and \\nTransition Risk or norms violation) companies which PMs select for new investment must be presented to the Committee for \\napproval. The CIO for Responsible Investments chairs this Committee which includes members of the CIO Office for Responsible \\nInvestments, Equity and Micro Research, Investment Risk Management, Compliance, and the Group Sustainability Officer. The \\nCRI reviews existing holdings based on certain criteria and also invites the responsible analyst to present an investment cas e \\nbased on an integrated analysis of financial and non-financial risks and opportunities including financial materiality. Based on \\ninternal ESG Engine evidence, third party research and the analysts’ assessments the CRI will either recommend the restrictio n \\non new investments, waives the investment restriction or requests a full disposal of existing holdings.

We regard active ownership as a powerful force in promoting \\nimproved (in the context of our ESG understanding) policies and practices of our investees and, in turn, driving superior long-term \\nperformance. We believe that good corporate governance is an important source of higher relative returns on equity and fixed \\nincome investments in the long-term. \\nWe continued to maintain a high degree of involvement with our investees globally using an engagement approach that is \\ndesigned to foster their governance practices and structures and successfully address governance issues. Our voting process \\ncentres on an evolving set of detailed expectations of good corporate governance and ESG integration, which are outlined in the \\nDWS Engagement Policy and Corporate Governance and Proxy Voting Policy.  \\nOur core expectations of corporate governance are explained in detail in this publicly available policy and can be summarised  in \\nthe five broad categories as on our website.\\n 38 \\n\\nEngagements and Proxy Voting \\nIn 2020, we continued our efforts in active ownership and held dedicated engagements with board and management members of \\ninvestee companies on environmental, social and governance topics. \\nOur investment professionals continued to regularly engage with the senior management of investee companies, whereby, in \\naddition to the fundamentals, strategy and outlook of the company, ESG topics were also discussed. Our engagement activities \\nare a key part of our ESG Integration Policy for Active Investment Management, Engagement Policy as well as our Corporate \\nGovernance and Proxy Voting Policy. They are based on the objective to improve the behaviour of an investee company as they \\nrelate to environmental, social and/ or corporate governance factors as well as topics like strategy, financial performance, risk, \\ncapital structure, social and environmental impact as well as disclosure, culture and remuneration. In our ESG integration \\napproach, engagement is undertaken by investment professionals in partnership with the Corporate Governance Center and ESG \\nIntegration team. Where there is a thematic engagement directed to a group of companies at the same time, the engagement \\nactivity would be undertaken by the Corporate Governance Center and the Head of ESG Integration whereby the Active \\ninvestment platform would be informed accordingly. We believe that the governance in ESG is the foundation for the adequate \\nmanagement of environmental and social issues. Our dedicated governance engagements are based on a thorough analysis of \\nthe independence and composition of boards, executive compensation, transparency on practices, transparency on auditors (for \\nexample selection, rotation and engagement), the fair treatment of shareholder rights as well as reporting practices. In cases \\nwhere we identify gaps between our expectations on ESG standards and the company\\'s attitude towards it, we may decide to \\nstart a direct engagement with the company representatives. If our initial engagement yields unsatisfactory results, we may take \\nadditional measures (e.g. letters to the Board, annual general meetings’ (AGM) attendance with a speech, etc.). In addition,  each \\nyear we send engagement letters to our investees, which elaborate on our core governance values. Next is the call for direct \\nmeetings with executives or the board chairperson. As a last measure, we will vote accordingly, thereby voting against \\nmanagement proposals, in line with our proxy voting guidelines. \\nOur voting policy and guidelines set out our active ownership philosophy and our views on corporate governance and sustainable \\nbusiness practices that support long-term value creation by companies. As in past years, we have reviewed our Corporate \\nGovernance & Proxy Voting Policy to ensure that our expectations remain robust against market standards and key \\ndevelopments in 2020. Reflecting the developments made in the policy in 2020 as well as our most eminent governance \\nexpectations formed out of the latest proxy voting season, the Corporate Governance Center, representing DWS Investment \\nGmbH, sent a pre-season letter of engagement to more than 1,300 investees, which were part of the Proxy Voting Focus List for \\n2020. Our pre-season letter represents an important first step into our engagement activities throughout the year by elaborating \\non our key focus areas as well as inviting our Focus List companies for a dialogue. \\nIn 2020, we had 454 engagements with 353 companies which represented more than an  82% increase versus the previous year. \\nConsidering the restrictions on public meetings in the context of COVID-19, many of this years’ annual general meetings took \\nplace online, without the physical presence of shareholders. Based on our commitment to foster good corporate governance and \\nin line with our active ownership approach, we have sent our questions to the boards of directors of 24 portfolio companies in \\nwritten form and made them also available on our website (For additional details see our Corporate Governance page on our \\nwebsite). Towards the end of the year, we also sent our individualized post-season letters to more than 390 of our investees, \\nwhere we had issues with particular items of their agenda and voted against management recommendations. Board composition \\nand transparency as well as executive compensation were among the most discussed governance topics during these \\nengagements.   \\nOne of the areas we prioritized in 2020 was climate change and the risks arising from it. Corporations and investors, as owners \\nand lenders have a key role to play towards the need for emissions to be reduced in the mutual goal of coping with the impacts of \\n\\n38\\n Additional details can be found here:  https://www.dws.com/solutions/esg/corporate-governance/    DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n87\\n \\nglobal warming. The changes so far have already had an impact in particular on the energy sector and the effects are expected to \\nbe amplified as the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions results in further changes to the climate. We increased our \\nscrutiny on companies that face substantial climate transition risks or seriously contravene with internationally recognized ESG \\nstandards (e.g. the UN Global Compact Principles, core principles of the International Labor Organization and OECD Guidelines \\nfor Multinationals. We have analysed our investees in the energy sector and have identified several common E, S and G issues, \\nwhich are causing or might cause reputational risks and might have material implications if not properly addressed: \\n−On the environmental side: pollution, oil spills; emissions.\\n−On the social side: impact on local communities and their heritage; human rights violations.\\n−On the governance side: bribery, corruption issues; poor oversight\\nAs a result of our analysis, we sent a thematic engagement letter to 53 companies, facing risks in the above mentioned areas, \\nasking them for specific and ambitious actions and inviting them for an engagement.  \\nInvolvement in the manufacturing of controversial weapons, most notably nuclear weapons or depleted uranium remained a key \\nchallenge also in 2020. The upcoming treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW) will further aggravate this \\ncontroversial business activity. The goal is to negotiate a legally binding treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons leading towards their \\ntotal elimination. Addressing our concerns that some of our investees could be involved in manufacturing of products that in the \\nworst case do not comply with treaties or legal bans on controversial weapons, we have sent six Aerospace/Defense companies \\nan engagement letter with our expectations on their current involvement, future strategy and possibly necessary measures to \\naccommodate changes arising from the TPNW coming into force January 22, 2021.  \\nIn 2020 for assets domiciled in our key European and Asian legal entities, we voted at a total of 2,370 meetings in 59 markets of \\nlisting, which represented an increase of 16% in the meetings voted compared to last year. The holdings are voted based on our \\nProxy Voting Focus List, which includes our most relevant holdings screened on assets and relevant ESG ratings. These \\nmeetings represented approximately 86% of our equity assets under management in Europe and Asia. We aim to gradually \\nincrease the number of meetings voted per year, making sure not to compromise on the quality of the analysis. The results for our \\nproxy voting and engagement is annually reported on our website\\n 39. For the mutual funds domiciled in the US, we strive to \\nexercise the voting rights for all equity holdings. In 2020, we voted at a total number of 9,355 meetings in 61 markets of listing.  \\nIn a report released by Ceres for the US proxy voting season 2020, DWS Investment Management Americas Inc. ranks among \\nthe top 10 asset managers with 88% in terms of support for climate related shareholder proposals .\\n40 \\n\\nDec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n% change\\n \\n\\nProxy Voting\\n \\n 11,725\\n \\n11,509\\n \\n2%\\n \\n\\nfor assets domiciled in Europe and Asia \\n(general meetings voted)\\n \\n 2,370\\n \\n2,043\\n \\n16%\\n \\n\\nCompanies voted\\n \\n 1,859\\n \\n1,722\\n \\n8%\\n \\n\\nfor assets domiciled in US (general meetings voted)\\n \\n 9,355\\n \\n9,466\\n \\n-\\n1%\\n\\nCompanies voted\\n \\n 6,720\\n \\n6,928\\n \\n-\\n3%\\n\\nAGM attendance globally / questions sent to company boards \\nfor virtual meetings\\n \\n24\\n \\n19\\n \\n26%\\n \\n\\nCorporate Engagements\\n \\n 454\\n \\n250\\n \\n82%\\n \\n\\nFor assets domiciled in Europe and Japan\\n \\n 394\\n \\n207\\n \\n90%\\n \\n\\nFor assets domiciled in US\\n \\n 60\\n \\n43\\n \\n40%\\n \\n\\nContribution to Action on Climate Change \\n[GRI 201-2] \\nCombatting climate change continued to be one of the most important ESG issues. DWS emphasizes its commitment through its \\npublicly communicated net zero goal and assumes the responsibility as financial market participant and the consequences of it s \\ninvestment decisions. For the future, both awareness and objective need become even more integrated into investment \\nprocesses which makes the role of climate change data even stronger. DWS commenced publishing reports on the investment \\nimplications of climate change already in October 2007. In 2020, we expanded our considerations to different facets of climate \\nchange. As in the past, climate change has been a key topic for our engagements and proxy voting. DWS has also made \\nsignificant progress through applying Climate and Transition Risks and opportunities (CTRR) to sovereign issuers. This key \\nmetric has become part of our research and investment process during the 4th quarter of 2020 and become part of the ESG \\ninvestment standards applicable for our dedicated ESG retail strategies during November 2020. \\n\\n39\\n For additional detail, our 2019 engagement report can be found here: https://download.dws.com/download?elib-assetguid=30dee87d3d7f46a29821ca2b3e6fcefb \\n\\n40 The link to the report can be found here for additional detail:  https://www.ceres.org/news-center/blog/new-power-comes- new-responsibility-how-asset-managers-can-improve-their-voting   DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain\\n ]\\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n88\\n \\nCompared to the more prominent environmental metrics such as those carbon-related, assessment on water is not as well \\npublicised and is more challenging. However water matters. Today, 25% of world economic growth is from countries facing \\nchronic water shortages, and by 2050, this is estimated to rise to 45%. Water resource, in particular fresh water, represents \\napproximately 2.5% of total water and less than 1% is available to sustain all terrestrial life and ecosystems. To make things even \\nworse, pollution, the loss of natural wetlands and the increasing likelihood of droughts coupled with drastic climate change are \\nadding further strains on the availability and quality of water resources. In 2020, we have implemented our existing CTRR score \\nto sovereigns and since November 2020 included water risks and opportunities at an issuer level. The resulting water risks an d \\nopportunities score ranges from A (“True leader –  very good water risk management while contributing to SDG-6”) to F (“True \\nlaggards, significantly exposed to water risk”). Both carbon risk & opportunity ratings and water risk & opportunity ratings  are \\naggregated together to form the DWS climate and transition risk rating. A third pillar, physical climate risk, is planned to be added \\nin 2021 subject to data availability. \\nWe will continue to further embed CTRR into our internal processes in 2021. On the development of metrics on CTRR and water \\nrisk, we are also working on developing improvement and reduction  targets for key areas of DWS’s investment portfolio. In \\nDecember 2020, DWS published water risks and opportunities as a research paper in order to inform investors about these \\ninvestment implications\\n 41.  \\nA further important development is the formal approval and integration of total carbon intensity on issuer level into our ESG \\nEngine factsheets, which allows our investment professionals to consider Scope 1-3 emissions plus avoided emissions in the \\ncontext of their asset allocation. \\nClimate Action proof points from Investment Division \\n−Continued our partnership with a significant corporate client and extended a clean energy fund to invest in climate solutions  in\\nChina in the context of the China Clean Energy Fund. In total this resulted to AuM and committed c apital exceeding € 320\\nmillion.\\n−Converted our DWS Invest Climate Tech into a dedicated ESG strategy, which exceeded € 130 million in AuM and where the\\nfund manager was awarded as “Handelsblatt Top Fondsmanager 2020”\\n−Continued to develop the Africa clean energy strategy with the UN Green Climate Fund.\\n−Promoted retail distribution campaigns for DWS Invest Green Bond fund and DWS Invest SDG Global Equities contributing to\\nassets under management of over € 100 million and € 1 billion, respectively\\n−DWS observed increased demand for ESG exposure during 2020, particularly from institutional investors looking to switch\\nfrom traditional indices into ESG equivalents. As a result, European listed DWS ESG ETFs exceeded € 3 billion in AuM. These\\nESG ETFs use an explicit carbon filter to provide access to environmentally conscious companies as measured by low CO2\\nemissions.\\nWithin our investments, we analyse the commitment made by companies to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and how \\nthese are reflected in executive compensation based on information our ESG Engine data, research provided by our proxy voting \\nservice advisors for individual AGMs as well as own analysis and engagements with companies. Another focus is the increasing \\nneed to combat climate change. This has resulted in various discussions with investee companies, working groups coming \\ntogether, new regulations being set at EU level and shareholders demanding more action from companies on this topic. \\nWe have continued our active support of the Climate Actio n 100+ initiative with engagements with one of the world’s largest \\ncorporate greenhouse gas emitters to curb emissions, strengthen climate-related financial disclosures and improve governance \\non climate change risks. In the last three years, the company has made improvements to the governance of ESG aspects. They \\nalso enhanced their reporting transparency for non-financial aspects and in this context also complied with the recommendations \\nof the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The company has sets ambitious Scope 1-3 targets as well \\nas clear and transparent exit-plans on coal usage. The implementation of these topics are governed by a committee on \\nmanagement board level and the management board also contains sufficient climate expertise which was a request by DWS at \\nthe company’s most recent AGM. Going forward, we will continue our constructive dialogue with the company .  \\nFurther examples on corporate engagement, policy advocacy and stakeholder education \\n−Continued engagement with major investees on corporate governance including on climate change related issues and\\ncontinued support for voting in favour of climate-related AGM resolutions in the US.\\n−As co-chair of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change’s (IIGCC) property  working group, DWS continues to help\\ndeveloping climate-related expectations of listed real estate companies.\\n−DWS joined the IIGCC Paris Aligned Investment Initiative and their credit, sovereign, equity, and real estate working groups\\n−DWS assumed its investor commitment to support a Just Transition on Climate Change through IIGCC and the EU Energy\\nEfficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG), DWS continued to advise policy makers on how to improve energy efficiency\\npolicies.\\n\\n41\\n Please see the link to additional information : (https://www.dws.com/insights/global-research-institute/a-transformational-framework-for-water-risk/ ).

Our CIO View consists of a consistent, transparent and repeatable decision-making process to ensure o ne \\nglobal house view on macroeconomic topics, our financial market forecasts, our outlooks for individual asset classes or our views \\non market risks. By including ESG information, we aim to reduce our investment risks, explore business areas with growing \\ndemand and leverage our central role in the investment process in order to make important contributions to society. We conside r \\nthis step as an important addition to our investment value chain and a way to consider ESG impacts into our sector allocation and \\nportfolio construction. The integration of ESG topics into our CIO View is continuously expanded to include relevant ESG trends. \\nIn 2020, DWS focussed on sustainability risks arising from violation of international norms and on publications in the 2 nd and 3rd \\nquarter on combining CTRR, Norm and SDG ratings with an implication on sector allocation. The insights are communicated \\nthrough our quarterly CIO View publication on our website\\n 42. \\n\\nResearch and Strategy related portfolio construction \\nResearch and portfolio management capabilities are fully integrated within our investment teams. Analysts carry out proprietary \\nresearch in their area of expertise within the global network, contributing to a broad global coverage of stocks, credit or other \\nfinancial instruments. Across the active equity platform analysts regularly share their knowledge and insights at a global level. \\nThese updates help identify global sector themes and trends and determine the implication of such trends for the assessment o f \\nsingle stocks.  \\nWe regard ESG integration as an investment approach that integrates ESG information into fundamental financial analysis to \\nimprove the estimate of the future expected risk / return of a security. All investment professionals of the relevant legal entities \\nwithin Active are bound by the ESG Integration Policy for Active Investment Management as well as the Engagement Policy. In \\n2020, the overall research process has been further improved to integrate ESG factors more closely into financial considerations. \\nDWS has tightened the ESG Integration Policy for employees on the Active investment platform such that all research analysts i n \\nequity and fixed income should include ESG aspects into earnings estimates, valuation models and investment recommendations \\nin a more detailed manner.  \\nAlready since 2019 this process has been implemented in the respective ESG integrated research notes for equity and fixed \\nincome research. During 2020, we have enhanced our Equity Research Handbook to feature ESG integration. This also includes \\na description of guiding policies, main sources of ESG data, key factors to be considered during the research process and \\ninformation about engagements and our proxy voting process. The goal for the investment professional is to understand any \\nmismatch between financially relevant ESG issues and the company’s strategy to manage these opportunities and risks. Our \\nCredit Research Handbook highlights ESG analysis as part of the initiation report whenever a new issuer is added to the research \\nplatform. It also continues to highlight the importance of ESG analysis, e.g. that corporate bonds with an E or F rating require a \\nwide spread overcompensating the risks and conduct engagement to help improve the company’s ESG profile  \\nAll of DWS’s equity holdings are in the scope of our Corporate Governance and Proxy Voting Policy and our focus list does not \\ndiscriminate between holdings in dedicated ESG strategies and non-ESG funds.  \\nThe results of this proprietary research are distributed in Aladdin Research and other processes are governed by the Head of \\nEquity and Co-Head of Micro Research (Fixed Income). \\nHuman Rights and Norm Assessment in the Investment Process \\n[GRI 412-3] \\n\\nDWS is fully committed to our responsibilities in relation to human rights and during 2020 has sought to raise awareness of the \\nimplications of norm assessments in the investment-  and sector allocation process. In April 2020, this “social” element of ESG \\nhas become part of DWS’s ESG CIO View\\n 43\\n. The Deutsche Bank Statement on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery \\nconstitutes a principle of how we are guided for the relevant legal entities. Further, the UN Guiding Principles clearly expect \\ncompanies to operate to a higher international standard in situations where national laws are not sufficient to respect human \\nrights. When controversies are assessed in the ESG Engine as part of our investment process, international norms are applied, \\nwhereby the guiding principles are codified in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). Other important norms are manifested \\n\\n42\\n For additional details the publications for our CIO View can be found on our website:  https://www.dws.com/insights/cio-view/cio-view-quarterly/  \\n\\n43 See here for additional information: https://www.dws.com/insights/cio-view/cio-view-quarterly/q1-2020/normative-judgments/  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n90\\n \\nby the International Labour Organisation (ILO) or OECD Guidelines for Multinational Corporations. Our ESG-Engine based norms \\ncompliance checks for:  \\n−human rights abuses or corporate complicity for such abuses\\n−adverse societal or community impact;\\n−violation of labour rights, most notably the right of collective bargaining and free association or\\n−neglected health & safety obligations;\\n−child labour and bonded or forced labour;\\n−adverse environmental impact (such as loss of biodiversity) and\\n−challenged business ethics, most notably incidents of bribery, market manipulation, fraud, corruption, etc.\\nIn terms of ESG data on norm compliance including human rights, DWS has made a norm rating update through the onboarding \\nof Arabesque S-Ray.  \\nThroughout 2020, the Committee for Responsible Investments analysed, discussed and included on issuers which have been \\nrated F from a Norm rating perspective, which includes in particular human rights. We have assessed e.g. particularly severe \\ncases of above sector-average fatality rates, health and safety or violation of labour rights despite COVID-19 related restrictions. \\nIn cases where challenged business ethics led to material improvements, the Committee decided to waive certain restrictions \\nconditional upon a close monitoring. As a result of our detailed analyses in the Committee for Responsible Investments, DWS has \\nengaged with an online retailer on labour rights issues and growing controversies around human rights. We have also intensively \\nanalysed and discussed North- and South American and emerging markets (partly) state-owned oil & gas and mining companies \\nwith a focus on occupational health and safety. \\nWe will continue to put a high emphasis on issuers’ norm compliance with a particular focus on en vironmental topics, climate \\nchange and human rights not only in our Committee for Responsible Investments but also in the form of company engagement \\nand due diligence in our general research processes. \\nESG Integration and Quality Management \\nOutside of our funds and strategies which are subject to our “smart integration of ESG” approach, DWS aims to be compliant with \\nArticle 6 of the SFDR. This means that in its investment decisions, DWS considers, in addition to financial data, sustainability \\nrisks. This consideration applies to the entire investment process, both in the fundamental analysis of investments and in the \\ndecision-making process. In the fundamental analysis, ESG criteria are evaluated within the internal corporate, sovereign and \\nsector analysis and ESG criteria are integrated into any further investment research. This includes the identification of global \\nsustainability trends, financially relevant ESG issues and challenges. Moreover, risks that may arise from the consequences o f \\nclimate change, or risks arising from the violation of internationally recognized guidelines are subject to special examination. The \\ninternationally recognized guidelines include, above all, the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, ILO core labour \\nstandards, or UN guiding principles for business and human rights and the OECD guidelines for multinational companies. \\nIf investments are made according to an ESG-integrated fundamental analysis, these investments will also continue to be \\nmonitored from an ESG perspective and a dialogue is sought with companies regarding better corporate governance and greater \\nconsideration of ESG criteria (e.g. via participation as a shareholder in the company, or by exercising voting and other \\nshareholder rights). We consider a prerequisite to ESG integration to be a broad availability and coverage of ESG data. This \\nallows our investment professionals to identify all material factors and to more effectively identify (and manage) risks and \\nopportunities as a result of these sustainability attributes. DWS only labels strategies that pursue an ESG integration approach as \\nbeing 1) actively managed and b) having a coverage of ESG data (the overall SynRating) of more than 90% of the portfolio. As of \\nDecember 31, 2020, we are able to classify combined € 396 billion in AuM in Active as ESG integrated where the coverage of \\nESG data exceeds 90%. This ESG integration figure excludes our dedicated ESG funds. Our PMs have real-time visibility of the \\nratings of issuers (pre and post transaction) and of their portfolio overall within Aladdin. On a regular basis, the ESG quality of the \\nportfolio can be reviewed in the context of Performance and Risk Review meetings and regular ESG gatekeeper meetings \\nprovide internal updates on engagement activities, policy and process updates on ESG integration / engagement, regulatory \\ndevelopments and issuer changes in terms of ESG-ratings. The quarterly CIO Day also addresses global ESG trends.  \\nESG transparency towards our Clients \\nIn 2020, we improved transparency to our clients on the ESG quality of those funds they evaluate or invest in. The goal is to \\nmake the ESG quality of a fund and carbon intensity elements more apparent. The framework provides understandable, well-\\ndefined and transparent measures for various ESG attributes. In the past, institutional clients have received bespoke client \\nreports on the ESG quality of their respective portfolios: The EKPI reports are available upon request in English and German for \\nall other dedicated ESG mutual funds of DWS and are continuously refined in an internal ESG Reporting Panel.   DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n91\\n \\nIn Germany our client relationship team together with our DWS ESG Advisory team have been able to convert various existing \\ninstitutional client mandates into an ESG version by either adopting a bespoke climate strategy, a bespoke negative list, a \\nnegative list by an ESG rating provider or by adopting DWS’s SynRatings (i.e. best -in-class ratings). This resulted in further \\ngrowth in the category “Institutional funds based on client -specific exclusions for institutional clients” (see section “Dedicated ESG \\nand Products with an ESG Integration Approach”).   \\nThroughout 2020, our discussions and workshops with institutional clients have had a deliberate focus on decarbonisation. In our \\nhome market Germany, the Relationship Managers for Institutional Clients within the Client Coverage Division have conducted \\nand held more than 60 workshops, survey, or introduction of ESG capabilities with more than 50 corporate-, insurance and \\npension clients or NPOs. This among others has led to net new ESG assets in existing client relationships or conversions of \\nexisting mandates into an investments with an ESG preference. These client events took place with the ESG Advisory Team in \\nour Products Division or representatives from the CIO Office for Responsible Investments. We have held various discussions on \\nlow carbon investment strategies with institutional clients in Germany. Among others this has led to a conversion of a Europe an \\ninvestment grade corporate bond mandate into a low carbon investment strategy. \\nRequirements under EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation \\nIn addition to the product classifications and corresponding product-level disclosures, EU SFDR also requires financial market \\nparticipants (FMPs) to issue a statement in relation to the consideration of principal adverse impacts in accordance with the \\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector of November 27, 2019 (Disclosure \\nRegulation). DWS intends to issue such statements for legal entities which are in scope of this requirement. In doing so, we will \\nrefer to existing policies and processes and to the best extent make use of existing data and new data submissions from third \\nparty vendors. We intend to offer additional courses to prepare investment professionals in order to consider principal adverse \\nimpacts in their decision making. \\nCreating Dedicated ESG Products \\nWe believe that our expertise and extensive experience in sustainable investing provides DWS with valuable insights that assist \\nand further protect and grow our clients’ assets over the long term. The growing importance of ESG is evidenced by regulatory  \\ndevelopments, independent academic research, and our own experience, which reveals that integrating ESG factors into the \\ninvestment process has the potential to improve performance and reduce risk. Due to improvements in our ESG Engine and \\nDWS’s organisational setup, we believe is in a better position than previous years to offer bespoke ES G solutions to clients based \\non their own ESG criteria. This is also as a result of improvements on ESG data such as climate transition risks for sovereigns \\nand water risks and opportunities in our ESG database.  \\nOur framework for dedicated ESG funds is built on the following pillars: \\nIn 2020 DWS has built upon its existing MESGS framework for DWS-branded ESG mutual funds and has extended selected \\ncriteria based on ESG Engine refinement and data availability. \\nThe application logic of our ESG investment standards (in case of investments in corporate issuers) is shown in the graphic \\nbelow. The letter rating ranges from A (no controversial sector involvement or no association with controversial weapons or n o \\nindications of violation of international norms; the issuer can be considered an ESG leader) to F (being involved in at least one \\ncontroversial sector or being associated with controversial weapons, or facing confirmed and severe violations of international \\nnorms or being an ESG laggard). Correspondingly, our mutual fund prospectuses and sales documentation give our retail clients \\nsufficient disclosure on how the ESG performance of an issuer is evaluated. Our sector-based reviews and analysis of \\nenvironmental and climate risks are targeted towards conservation of flora and fauna, protection of natural resources, \\natmosphere and inshore waters, limitation of land degradation and climate change and avoidance of encroachment on \\necosystems and loss of biodiversity. In the past year, we have extended the ESG investment scheme so that Climate and \\nTransition Risk Ratings now include water risks and opportunities. In addition we decided to become more strict on revenues \\ngenerated from coal-related activities and lowered the threshold to 15% instead of 25%. This new threshold will become effective \\non January 1, 2021 for our dedicated ESG retail strategies. For 2021, fund prospectuses will need to give additional detail i n \\norder to accommodate EU SFDR.

We managed assets with a  \\ntotal volume of € 793 billion (as of Dec ember 31, 2020). In order to account for the structure of our asset base, we defined AuM \\nas a) assets held on behalf of clients for investment purposes and / or b) client assets that are managed by us on a discretionary \\nor advisory basis. Within Alternative investments, this can either be fee-earning committed or fee-earning invested capital. \\nWe generally follow industry standards and guidelines in classifying ESG AuM. Through regional organisations such as the \\nEuropean Sustainable Investment Forum (EuroSIF), the US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (USSIF) and UK \\nSustainable Investment and Finance Association (UKSIF), investor reporting to the Global Sustainable Investment Association \\n(GSIA) has become a global standard for categorising ESG assets, and we follow its methodology. In 2020, DWS has worked \\ntowards a classification of its investment products towards Article 6, Article 8 or Article 9 of the SFDR for those products in scope \\nof the regulation.  \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Dec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n% change\\n \\n\\nActive management with dedicated ESG\\n \\n 58,017\\n \\n40,686\\n \\n43%\\n \\n\\nPortfolios based on client\\n-\\nspecific exclusions for institutional clients\\n \\n 32,660\\n \\n24,662\\n \\n32%\\n \\n\\nRetail and institutional assets managed according \\nto uniformly defined investment standards or client\\n-\\nspecific \\n\\nderivations\\n \\n 20,129\\n \\n13,090\\n \\n54%\\n \\n\\nSustainability themed ESG products\\n \\n 1,270\\n \\n591\\n \\n115%\\n \\n\\nThird\\n-\\nparty initiated mutual funds applying external ESG approach\\n \\n 3,958\\n \\n2,343\\n \\n69%\\n \\n\\nPassive \\ninvestments with dedicated ESG\\n \\n 17,550\\n \\n10,869\\n \\n61%\\n \\n\\nExchange traded funds (ETFs)\\n \\n 8,345\\n \\n2,452\\n \\n240%\\n \\n\\nPassively managed mandates for institutional clients\\n \\n 9,205\\n \\n8,417\\n \\n9%\\n \\n\\nTotal dedicated sustainable AuM (Active and Passive)\\n \\n 75,567\\n \\n51,555\\n \\n47%\\n \\n DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n93\\n \\nin € m.\\n \\n Dec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n% change\\n \\n\\nSustainable investment funds / impact investments\\n \\n 589\\n \\n715\\n \\n-\\n18%\\n\\nPrivate equity or debt funds focused on sustainable/impact investing, including public\\n–\\nprivate “blended finance” \\n\\nfunds with \\nenvironmental or social objectives\\n \\n 589\\n \\n715\\n \\n-\\n18%\\n\\nReal estate\\n \\n 16,553\\n \\n16,527\\n \\n0%\\n \\n\\nCertified green\\n-\\nlabelled buildings (Energy Star, LEED, BREEAM, etc.)\\n \\n 16,553\\n \\n16,527\\n \\n0%\\n \\n\\nInfrastructure\\n \\n 889\\n \\n862\\n \\n3%\\n \\n\\nRenewable assets, both in debt and equity \\ninvestments, including solar, wind and waste\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nenergy\\n \\n889\\n \\n862\\n \\n3%\\n \\n\\nTotal sustainable AuM in real estate and infrastructure\\n \\n 18,031\\n \\n18,104\\n \\n0%\\n \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Dec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n%  change\\n \\n\\nESG Integration in Active\\n \\n 395,998\\n \\n392,698\\n \\n1%\\n \\n\\nESG integration in Alternatives\\n \\n 63,178\\n \\n58,317\\n \\n8%\\n \\n\\nESG integration within Liquid Real Assets\\n \\n 19,100\\n \\n20,897\\n \\n-\\n9%\\n\\nESG integration within Direct Real Estate\\n \\n 33,367\\n \\n26,988\\n \\n24%\\n \\n\\nESG integration within Infrastructure\\n \\n 10,711\\n \\n10,432\\n \\n3%\\n \\n\\nTotal integrated ESG assets at DWS\\n \\n 459,176\\n \\n451,015\\n \\n2%\\n \\n\\nActive \\n\\nIn 2020, our Active portfolio management teams were responsib le for € 58.0 billion of dedicated ESG AuM and for € 520.2 billion \\nof total AuM in Active and LRA.

This \\nincludes actively managed strategies in the Liquid Real Assets space\\n 44. \\n\\n−Portfolios managed based on client-driven exclusions: strategies where sustainability is an explicit part of the investment\\nguidelines, universe, selection and investment process. Exclusions of sectors or specific norm violations are specified by th e\\nESG Engine & Solutions team towards the Investment Guideline Coding team. By definition, these portfolios are for\\ninstitutional clients only. In 2020, we reported € 32.7 billion.\\n−Portfolios managed according to DWS’s uniformly defined investment standards (please refer to section ‘Building Dedicated\\nESG Products’) or client-specific derivations: these are mutual funds branded as DWS carrying ESG in the name. In 2020 we\\nreported € 20.1 billion in this category. For those strategies domiciled in the European Union, we are working towards\\nclassifying these products as Article 8 of SFDR\\n−Sustainability themed ESG products: sustainability-founded strategies which go beyond DWS’s uniformly defined investment\\nstandards and provide additional screening for either green bonds or contribution to the SDGs. In 2020 we reported\\n€ 1.3 billion mainly attributable to the successful distribution of our SDG and Green Bond strategies. For those strategies\\ndomiciled in the European Union, we are working towards classifying these products as Article 9 of SFDR\\n−Third-party initiated or third-party managed funds applying an externally defined ESG approach: mutual fund product initiators\\noutside of DWS Group, where either portfolio management or advisory on the product is provided by a 3rd party. In 2020, we\\nreported € 4.0 billion in this category. We expect that external ini tiators of these strategies will approach DWS as management\\ncompany to classify some of these strategies as Article 8 or 9 of SFDR conditional upon adjustments to the products legal\\ndocuments.\\n−Actively managed portfolios following DWS’s Smart Integration a pproach and actively managed portfolios with ESG integration\\napproach (see section ‘ESG Integration and Quality Management’): In 2020, we reported € 396 billion in this  category out of €\\n520.2 billion in Active. We expect both products following Smart Integration and ESG integration will be classified as Article 6\\nfor strategies falling under the scope of SFDR.\\nPassive \\nOur Passive portfolio management teams were responsible for € 17.5 billion of ESG AuM and for € 178.8 billion total AuM. The \\nteam implements proxy voting for applicable ETFs, supported by the Corporate Governance Center and makes use of the ESG \\nEngine for helping to implement investment decisions. In 2020, for creating passive managed solutions in our institutional client \\nspace, we can rely on existing or customised ESG indices, closely cooperating with index providers, or we can use our \\nproprietary ESG Engine to filter a standard market index. \\n\\n44\\n We define Liquid Real Assets (LRA) as an investment style within our Alternatives business but which  – unlike most vehicles within Alternatives – has daily net asset value and daily liquidity. \\nSome portfolios within LRA are mutual funds in line with US 1940 Act or UCITS-compliant.  The entire Liquid Real Assets team manages AuM amounting to € 21.3 billion.

In particular, Alternatives is subject to the existing DWS Reputational Risk Key Operating Procedures and the Sanctions \\nand Embargoes Policy and all new Alternatives product launches must also go through the NPA, which requires sign off from the \\nResponsible Investment Center as a condition to product launch. Outside of our sustainable investment funds, Alternatives aim s \\nto be compliant with Article 6 of the SFDR and will continue to strengthen our ESG integration efforts to both promote ongoing \\ncompliance with SFDR and honour our fiduciary duty to mitigate risk and maximize returns for our investors. \\nESG Integration for Alternatives \\nWithin Alternatives, ESG is integrated into the investment process primarily during investment due diligence and active portfolio \\nmanagement. Integration of ESG into the investment process enables us to identify the risks and opportunities that a traditio nal \\nanalysis would miss, or fail to systematically address, potentially resulting in a significant impact on long-term investment \\nperformance. DWS’s “Smart Integration” program does not apply to Alternatives except for the European -domiciled mutual funds \\nmanaged by the LRA business. The inherent differences between the liquid and illiquid asset classes require that the approach to \\nESG integration for Alternatives be tailored specific to the relevant Alternatives asset classes as outlined in the sections below.  \\nESG in Real Estate \\nOur real estate business continues to position ESG as integral to investment decision making. At the core of the approach is our \\ngoal to preserve and maximize risk-adjusted returns and to reduce environmental risk, improve asset efficiency, and deliver high-\\nquality spaces to tenants. In 2020, we executed the regional 2019 sustainability action plans and adopted the global 2020 Real \\nEstate ESG House View. The 2020 Real Estate ESG House View builds on the existing ESG program framework and consists of \\nthe following five-stage ESG program for our real estate assets managed from Europe and the Americas: \\n\\n−1. Data Collection: Actively collect a broad and robust asset-level ESG dataset on a regular basis to assist in sustainability\\nreporting, informed decision-making and in unlocking improvement opportunities. The collection of asset-level ESG data\\nbegins prior to all acquisitions during due diligence and continues throughout the holding period of all portfolio assets.\\n−2. Risk Review: Perform an ESG risk review on each asset prior to acquisition and on all portfolio assets on an annual basis\\nwith a focus on key ESG risks and opportunities in the following areas:\\n\\uf0b7Carbon Transition Risk\\n\\uf0b7Natural and Physical Climate Risk\\n\\uf0b7Social Norms Risk\\n−3. Goal Setting: Set platform and portfolio-level performance goals based upon bottom-up asset-level action planning and top-\\ndown investor and industry drivers.\\n−4. Implementation: Create and execute asset-level action plans that represent the best value in terms of improving\\nsustainability performance, decreasing operating costs, and increasing tenant satisfaction.\\n−5. Measurement and Impact: Based on the implementation activities, track progress in project implementation relative to our\\ngoals and evaluate the value created for the asset, portfolio and platform. Compare performance with peers using industry\\nstandards and benchmarks such as GRESB and UN PRI.\\n 1. Data Collection\\n2. Risk Review\\n3. Goal Setting4. Implementation5.

We implemented energy \\nand water-related projects across 50 properties in the US representing a net investment of €  4.3 million during 2020. In addition to \\nour energy efficiency programming, we have also commenced projects and assessments to address other ESG topics critical to \\nreal estate including smart buildings, health & wellbeing, and climate resilience pursuant to the Real Estate ESG House View. \\nAs of the end of 2020, we managed €  16.6 billion of AuM in properties with green label designations. These green labels include, \\nbut are not limited to, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED); Building Research Establishment Environmental \\nAssessment Methodology (BREEAM); and ENERGY STAR, a US-government-backed rating for energy efficiency.  \\nWith respect to reduction targets and measurement across our real estate portfolio, we have committed to the following: \\n\\n−2030 carbon reduction goal (Europe offices): In October of 2019, we announced a commitment to achieve a 50% reduction in\\ncarbon emissions intensity by 2030 across our entire portfolio of Europe office properties against a baseline year of 2017\\n 50.\\n\\n−2050 Net Zero carbon goal (European-managed portfolio): In October of 2019, we also became one of the founding\\nsignatories of the Better Buildings Partnership Climate Change Commitment, and recently published our first  pathway to net\\nzero emissions on their website. In addition, DWS co-chaired the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC)\\nReal Estate Net Zero Investment Framework to further guide our business and the industry to climate action through\\nconsistent reporting and concerted action.\\n\\n−2030 energy reduction goal (US offices): In 2011, we first committed to the US Department of Energy’s Better Buildings\\n\\nChallenge, where we set a goal of improving the energy efficiency of five million square feet of properties by 20% before 2020.\\nWe met this objective four years ahead of schedule at the end of 2016. Since then we have renewed our commitment to the\\nchallenge to achieve another 20% energy intensity reduction by 2030 across our entire US office portfolio. In 2020, this goal\\nwas updated to a 25% reduction in energy and carbon intensity by 2030 across our landlord controlled US office portfolio with\\nthe intent that this target will serve as the foundation for a future carbon reduction target that also includes decarbonization.\\n 51\\n\\n−2030 water reduction goal (US offices): As part of our renewed commitment to the Better Buildings Challenge, in 2017, we\\nadded a water reduction goal of 20% by 2030 for our US office portfolio and have already reduced water intensity by 21%.\\n 52\\nThe above goals are intensity measures that are calculated in terms of emissions or utility consumption by floor area and as  a \\npercentage change against a baseline year of 2017. In 2019, we began measuring and reporting on our European office carbon \\nreduction goal and established a preliminary carbon reduction goal for our US office portfolio based on reducing energy intensity. \\nStrong progress has already been made against the energy and carbon reduction goals for our office portfolios. We have already \\nachieved 10% reduction in energy and 16% carbon intensity reduction across our European office portfolio\\n 53 and 13% reduction \\nin energy intensity and a 13% reduction of carbon intensity across our US office portfolio.\\n 54 In 2021 we plan to keep measuring \\nand reporting on existing goals across the global business and will be further exploring decarbonization strategies in the US. \\nIn order to provide transparency to our investors, we report into the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), which \\nprovides an independent assessment of portfolios and funds using a peer-based approach and scoring based on several ESG \\nmetrics. In addition to our participation in GRESB we have a seat on its Real Estate Benchmarking Committee to help drive the \\ncontinued refinement of the survey. In 2020, we reported on 15 of our portfolios (worth €  36.0 billion of AuM out of € 55.6 billion in \\nglobal AuM for DWS Direct Real Estate in 2019, representing 64.7% of the total global real estate AuM for the 2020 reporting \\nperiod ending December 31, 2019), and 14 of the 15 portfolios achieved Green Star recognition through the GRESB assessment. \\n−Policies and procedures: We have an updated ESG House View in place, which was approved by the regional Investment\\nCommittees (the governing approval bodies for our regional real estate investment business) in Europe and the Americas in\\n2020. We complete annual Sustainability Action Plans for each regional business, which are approved annually by the\\nInvestment Committees in the respective region. These documents provide the overarching strategy and the detailed plans on\\nexecution of our ESG strategy for the businesses. The commitments in the annual Sustainability Action Plans are incorporated\\ninto portfolio-level sustainability action planning to ensure ongoing management support of sustainability programming.\\nAdditionally, there are ESG components in the key operating procedures documentation for the business.\\n−ESG Assessment process: For all new prospective property acquisitions, we complete an ESG Acquisition Checklist during\\nthe ESG risk review portion of the due diligence process, a requirement we made mandatory in all regions in 2019. The results\\nof the ESG risk review are then incorporated into the Investment Committee memo and any key recommendations are then\\nincorporated into a section within the narrative of the memo. The recommendations highlight ESG risks and opportunities to\\nimprove asset performance, some of which may be opportunities linked to reduction targets. Examples include heightened\\nexposure to physical climate risk and resiliency measures, opportunities for investment in energy efficiency to reduce costs\\n\\n50\\n Carbon intensity measured in kilograms of CO2 emissions equivalent per square meter.. \\n\\n51 Note that the current US carbon reduction target is based solely on efforts to reduce energy intensity through energy efficiency programming and this target includes the assumption that the \\nemission factors remain constant. \\n\\n52 Figure as of June 30, 2020.

The ESG risk review performed on prospective acquisitions is also performed on all portfolio assets on an annual \\nbasis. ESG risks and opportunities identified during the annual risk review are documented in the portfolio’s Sustain ability \\nAction Plan along with any recommendations relating to ESG risks and opportunities identified during the annual risk review. \\n−Monitoring: As part of our asset and property management activities, we monitor properties and portfolios around key ESG\\nmetrics to identify potential ESG initiatives we want to engage in at the property level. This information feeds into the capit al\\nplans and rolls up into the annual Sustainability Action Plans for each portfolio and the business respectively.\\nAs a result of our data collection efforts, consistent risk reviews, and monitoring of ESG data quality, DWS’s Direct Real Estate \\nbusiness integrates ESG information across a global portfolio of €  33.4 billion in AuM excluding green label buildings . \\nESG in Infrastructure \\n\\n[GRI 203-1] \\n\\nESG considerations are incorporated into the investment framework of the Infrastructure business at all stages of the investment \\nlifecycle for equity investments, from the initial screening and due diligence to the asset management and exit stages. During the \\nholding period, we monitor the ESG attributes of the investments through quarterly reporting of sector-specific\\n 55 3 key \\nperformance indicators (KPIs), discussion at management meetings, and integration of those issues into business plans. Our due \\ndiligence will also consider governance topics such as fraud, bribery, sanctions and compliance, as required. Findings from the \\ndue diligence phase are incorporated into the Investment Committee paper and presented to the Investment Committee for \\nconsideration.  \\nThe Infrastructure business also places emphasis on reporting, producing an annual Sustainable and Responsible Investment \\n(SRI) report for investors in two of our infrastructure funds. This report address issues such as Health & Safety and Security; \\nCommunity Service; Labour and Diversity Issues; Transparency, Communication and Governance; and Environmental Issues at \\nthe fund’s underlying investments. The Infrastructure business also manages a portfolio of €  889\\n56 million in sustainability themed \\nrenewable energy and energy transition assets, both in debt and equity investments, including solar, wind, and waste-to -energy. \\nTo understand the ongoing ESG performance of our funds and assets against peers, we take part in the GRESB infrastructure \\nassessment at both fund and asset level. We are a member of GRESB and sit on the Infrastructure Benchmarking Committee to \\nhelp drive the development of industry standards with respect to ESG. We also report to PRI and achieved an A rating in 2020 for \\nthe Infrastructure module. \\nDuring 2020 we continued to operate in line with the Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) that was developed \\nand implemented in 2019 to further strengthen and standardise our due diligence process and monitoring of assets. The ESMS \\napplies to all potential investments in infrastructure equity and current portfolio investments in infrastructure equity. The ESMS \\ndocuments ESG policies and procedures at all levels of the DWS Infrastructure business, and details how ESG considerations \\nare incorporated in due diligence and asset management procedures. The ESMS also creates obligations on portfolio companies \\nto ensure regular reporting to DWS Infrastructure and compliance with all of the applicable regulations regarding ESG issues. \\nAs a result of this regular reporting and engagement, DWS Infrastructure aims to help drive improvements in ESG metrics and \\nperformance at its portfolio companies with a view to improving the businesses\\' sustainability credentials and to create value. \\n−Policies: The Infrastructure business is governed by an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS), which\\nprovides the overarching framework, processes and governance for our ESG integration approach in Infrastructure.\\n−ESG Assessment process: Similar to real estate, we have an ESG checklist which is implemented during the acquisitions\\nprocess for all prospective equity investments. The findings are then incorporated in the Investment Committee (IC) memo.\\n−Monitoring: As part of the asset management process, we collect data on key ESG metrics within each of the operating\\ncompanies. This information is then used to better refine our asset management strategies and is also reported to our\\ninvestors in the form of a Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) Report. Certain KPIs, such as those around\\noccupational health and safety, are also embedded into the performance review process for the operating companies.\\nAdditionally, we report into GRESB for both our PEIF I and II funds and are planning to report into GRESB for PEIF III in 2021.\\nThe Infrastructure Debt business, in collaboration with DWS Research, has developed a bespoke proprietary ESG scoring \\nmethodology applicable to private infrastructure debt investments, which will be rolled out to new investments in 2021 to support \\nthe overall investment process and ongoing monitoring of ESG risks for private infrastructure debt investments. This methodology \\nwill guide the ESG due diligence performed on each asset by the investment team and assign an ESG rating to each potential \\n\\n55\\n  Examples include energy consumption, water consumption, waste generation and completed projects.\\n\\n56 Valuations of € 426 million of equity investments made within Pan-European Infrastructure Fund II and Pan-European Infrastructure Fund III are per September  30, 2020. Equity investments \\nare revalued each quarter. Year-end 2020 figures will be made available in the context of fourth quarter 2020 reporting to investors on March 30, 2021 and April 30, 2021 for the two funds. \\nDebt investment amounts are generally set and do not change unless debt is repaid.

A summary of the \\nESG rating will be incorporated into all investment committee memos, to form part of the investment decision making process. \\nThese initial ESG scores will be updated every year based on periodic ESG KPIs reported by borrowers. \\nAs a result of our commitments, policies, procedures, and monitoring of ESG data quality, DWS’s Infrastructure Equity busines s \\nintegrates ESG across € 10.7 billion of AuM in private equity infrastructure investments excluding sustainability themed assets. \\nESG in Private Equity \\nIn 2019, the business adopted a standard process to review potential investments from an ESG perspective: \\nScreening: ESG metrics relevant to investment opportunities must be evaluated preliminarily to be considered further during the \\ndue diligence process. The types of risks screened for include governance issues, such as potential fraud or reputational risks; \\nsocial issues with the workforce or the surrounding communities; environmental risks; occupational health & safety issues and \\naccident track record. \\nDue Diligence: During due diligence on specific investment opportunities, the investment team will review the potential transaction \\n\\ncounterparty’s ESG Policy and framework and assess the extent to which the investment and the manager in the potential \\ntransaction adhere to the key concepts defined by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The business also reviews the \\nrisks and KPIs most relevant to the industries in which it invests, and opportunities are often benchmarked against the ESG \\nleaders in both the company’s asset class and among comparable alternatives within the industry. Findings are then docume nted \\nin the Investment Committee memorandum, which will then be submitted to the Investment Committee for consideration as part \\nof the deal evaluation. The team will continue to refine its ESG approach around monitoring and engagement as needed. \\n\\nClient Experience \\nOur fiduciary duty defines how we conduct business every day: in the best interest of our clients. We therefore strive to embed \\nclient centricity throughout our organization as a guiding principle, as we firmly believe client satisfaction to be best reflected in \\nour daily interactions and in the long-term relationships with our clients. We aspire to the highest quality in our interactions with \\nclients and advisors, as well as to continuously improve the quality of our services. The organizational structure reflects this \\ncommitment towards our clients. In 2020, following changes on the Executive Board whereby we moved towards one unified \\nglobal responsibility for our distribution teams, we further reflected this commitment in the structure of our Client Coverage \\nDivision: globally aligned, yet regionally suited. This enables us to serve clients and markets locally, but in a globally consistent \\nmanner. We have therefore tailored our Client Coverage teams along four regions: APAC, the Americas, EMEA (excluding \\nGermany & Austria) and Germany & Austria. A global coordination is ensured by four segments: Institutional & Consultants, \\nWholesale & Digital, Insurance and Private & Real Assets as well as Passive Sales. All client coverage heads of the respectiv e \\nregions and segments report to the Global Head of the Client Coverage Division. \\nTo reflect the tremendous importance of ESG, we established a dedicated global role, the ESG Client Officer, to ensure this topic \\nis a focus in our strategic client relationships. The ESG Client Officer intersects between our clients, our Global Sustainability \\nOffice and our client relationship managers. Supporting and advancing the Client Coverage Division are the Global COO as well \\nas a dedicated client coverage COO for the Americas. A close collaboration with both the Product and Investment Division, as \\nwell as across the wider organization is ensured, as the Client Coverage Division acts as the advocate for our clients also \\ninternally, working to satisfy and solve their needs .  \\nEspecially during the COVID-19 pandemic, DWS focused on being in close touch with our clients to be the trusted advisor that \\nprovides guidance in uncertain times. We were able to double the number of participants of our market update calls in just 10 \\ndays in the first weeks of the pandemic in Germany, reaching around 4,500 participants. Furthermore, we reached 50,000 \\nfollowers on the social media network LinkedIn in 2020. These examples underline that our consequent communication efforts \\nthroughout the crisis enabled us to increase the contact and interaction with our clients.  \\nOur approach to assessing a comprehensive client experience is based on three pillars, namely complaint management, client \\nsatisfaction surveys and third party assessments. \\nComplaint Management \\nThe first pillar in assessing our clients’ satisfaction is the management of customer complaints: DWS is committed to handlin g \\ncomplaints fairly, effectively and promptly. The complaint register provides valuable insights into how we are performing from our \\nclients’ perspective. A robust and consistent client complaint handling and reporting process helps facilitate improvement in  client \\nsatisfaction by identifying, and remediating poor client outcomes, learning from and, thereby assisting with the reduction of  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Sustainable Finance\\n , ESG Products and Responsible \\n\\nInvesting\\n \\n\\n100\\n \\nmistakes and attributable costs, risk transparency enhancement and management information. As an overall result, client-centric \\ncomplaint management provides an opportunity to rebuild and enhance customer relationships.  \\nWe follow Deutsche Bank’s Code of Conduct, which includes a complaint handling policy framework to facilitate a consistent \\napproach to complaint management, as well as oversight according to regulatory requirements. All complaints must be handled \\nfairly, impartially and without undue delay. A client may raise a complaint either directly or through an authorised third party. \\nEvery complaint against a member of DWS Group must be identified as such and all relevant information must be tracked and \\nstored in a durable medium in line with Deutsche Bank’s record management principles, which have been adopted by DWS.   \\nInformation on our complaint process and contact details are provided to clients via the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive \\n(MiFID) starter pack and also published on our external websites. New complaints are screened for recurring issues and logged \\nin the complaint register to provide oversight on the type of complaints (clustered by DB Group-wide non-financial risk type \\ntaxonomy), materiality/severity, and time to closure. Oversight metrics are reported to DWS and DB Group’s senior management, \\nDWS and DB Group Compliance. The complaint register and supervisory controls are subject to periodic reviews by Compliance, \\nGroup Audit and our external auditor. \\nIn 2020, the number of complaints has decreased compared to the previous year. Two root causes have been identified: Firstly, \\nannual tax certificates have been distributed late and partially incorrect, secondly, stricter Know Your Client (KYC) requirements \\nwith regards to the proof of legitimacy of account holders came into effect in Luxembourg. Corresponding measures have been \\ntaken to improve internal workflow for 2021. \\nClient Satisfaction Surveys \\nThe second pillar in assessing our client’s satisfaction are clie nt satisfaction surveys. These are conducted at several points \\nacross our various businesses. \\nThe service centre for our digital investment platform (DIP) is based in Germany, servicing our clients using DWS Direct service \\nofferings. This enables our German clients and advisors to have personal access to the investment platform via telephone or \\nemail. This offering is not available in the APAC and Americas region. Since 2008, we have commissioned an external service \\nprovider to conduct client satisfaction surveys (for B2C) in order to improve our service quality and client experience. The annual \\nclient satisfaction survey amongst our clients focuses on perceived service quality, professionalism, and service process \\ntransparency to ensure client feedback is integrated into our quality assurance and optimisation measures. \\nClients and advisors can rate their satisfaction on topics such as friendliness of staff, professional competence, comprehensibility \\nand solution orientation as well as sales-specific questions. The results are communicated internally by our service centre quality \\nmanagement and training team to relevant internal stakeholders, i.e. senior management, service centre staff, and the workers \\' \\ncouncil. Based on the respective feedback, steps for improvement are formulated and incorporated into employee training, \\ninternal knowledge tools, client correspondence, and client- and advisor-related processes. We maintained excellent ratings in \\nadvisor satisfaction regarding ‘recommended solutions’, ‘professional competence’ and ‘friendliness’. Further, our advisors rated \\nas ‘likely to recommend our telephone services to colleagues’, which we view as evidence for client loyalty.   \\nAdditionally, we asked distributors (B2B) in Germany for their feedback regarding their experiences with our regional service \\ncentre. Two options were offered - either clients could stay on the line after a call with our call centre to do a so called “Voice -\\nSurvey” or they received an E-Mail with a respective link to the questionnaire (“E-Mail Survey”). In comparison to 2019, we were \\nable to improve in 2020 in the areas of “solutions offered” and “expertise”. 72% of all participants were “highly satisfied”  or \\n“satisfied” with the additional information provided during the COVID -19 pandemic. \\nFor our US insurance and institutional business, we conduct an annual client satisfaction survey focussing on investment \\nperformance and other areas of improvement, such as relationship management, innovation and overall satisfaction.  \\nThird Party Assessment \\nThe third pillar of assessing our client’s satisfaction are third party assessments.

and capital. As part of t his com-\\nmitment, we will release a yearly TCFD Report going-forward (please see  ‘Summarized Management Report - Sustainability \\nStrategy’).  \\nPeople Strategy and Attractive Employer \\nEmployees and Workplace \\nPeople Strategy and Employee Effectiveness \\n2020 has been an unprecedented year in many ways. DWS has continued to thrive despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This has \\nbeen possible by recognising the critical importance and resilience of our people and understanding that the success of the firm \\ndepends on the commitment, ideas and engagement of our organisation. And despite the challenges of remote working, we \\ncontinue to create a working environment in which our people can be innovative, work in partnership and are enabled to delive r \\nlong term sustainable performance.  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n People Strategy\\n  \\nand Attractive Employer\\n  \\n\\n103\\n \\nKey areas of focus this year have included: \\n−development of a new Functional Role Framework to establish a performance-driven culture across the firm\\n−enhancing our Human Capital Reporting in line with international standards\\n−introduction of the Global Leadership Team and Global Operating Council\\n−prioritising and proactively supporting the wellbeing and mental health of colleagues throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\\n−adapting our ways of working to become more agile and flexible through remote working\\n−initiation of firm’s core platform transformation\\n−embedding new diversity and inclusion opportunities across the organisation\\n−recognising and celebrating employees by highlighting their achievements inside and outside of DWS\\nFunctional Role Framework \\nIn one of the most substantial people initiatives in our organisation’s history DWS is transforming the firm by removing corporate \\ntitles and introducing a new DWS specific Functional Role Framework to create an environment where skills, capabilities and \\nexperience count more than hierarchy. This will become a key enabler for sustainable people management across the firm in the \\nfuture. \\nThe new framework is set up to best match roles to our client and organisational needs and gives the firm the opportunity to \\ntransform into an agile, globally competitive asset manager that attracts, retains and develops the very best people. It aspires to \\nempower employees, drive innovation, remove hierarchical boundaries, accelerate the speed of decision making and offer \\nrewarding career paths for all. \\nThe Functional Role Framework is also set up to reduce complexity, break down barriers and create a more modern work \\nenvironment that unlocks the performance potential across the firm. It will do this by aiming to build a collaborative environment \\nwith flat hierarchies based on functional roles, skills and capabilities and will better distinguish between employees who ar e \\n“experts” and those that are “leaders”.  \\nAs well as giving employees a better understanding of the career options and pathways available to them, the new framework will \\nembed stronger dialogue with managers. One of the standout changes allows role-based career progression to take place \\nthroughout the course of the year rather than being restricted to a single annual cycle, whilst personal growth continues to take \\nplace of the time. Additionally, role “families” will be introduced and within each “family” employees will be able to see pa thways \\nthat extend all the way up to senior roles. Each role will have its own expectations and role description to highlight the skills \\nneeded to be successful. \\nTogether with divisional representatives across all regions, seniority levels and cultural backgrounds, a new initiative to recognise \\nand celebrate individual achievements and career progression will be introduced in the absence of corporate title promotions. \\nHuman Capital Reporting Certification  \\nDWS recognises that the effective management and development of our human capital is a key driver of our organisational \\nsuccess. It is also a fundamental part of our commitment to the Social and Governance pillars of ESG and our aspiration to \\nsupport the global community in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, including decent work for all (goal 8) and \\nreducing inequality (goal 10). To realise the value of our human capital DWS recognises it is important to transparently measure \\nand report on our performance in this regard. \\nThis is in line with increasing ESG disclosure standards requirements, including new global human capital reporting standards \\nthat were released at the end of 2018 by the International Standards Organisation  – ISO 30414 “Human Resource management \\n– Guidelines for internal and external human capital reporting” –  and in August 2020 the SEC specifically included human capital\\nin its revised disclosure standards. At DWS, to enhance our commitment to ESG, our human capital and the sustainable\\ncorporate management of our organisation, our human capital disclosures have been brought into line with these best practice\\nstandards.\\nDWS was certified according to ISO 30414 standards in early 2021 for the Human Capital Reporting 2019 and aspires to be a \\nleader in this developing area of disclosure. This is particularly so given enhanced human capital disclosures can improve \\ninvestment analysis, investee engagement and stewardship, client understanding and the management of business organisations \\ngenerally.  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n People Strategy\\n  \\nand Attractive Employer\\n  \\n\\n104\\n \\nEmployer Attractiveness \\nCulture Strategy \\nFaced with a global pandemic that challenged historical ways of working, the fir m’s collective resilience and “can-do” attitude has \\nseen DWS continue to thrive in 2020. This was heavily reflected in this year’s DWS People Survey, indicating strong employee \\nengagement. 69% (2019: 63%) of employees shared feedback and provided almost 9,000 free text comments. Additionally, 53 \\nout of 55 trend questions significantly improved against the 2019 People Survey and most encouragingly, both commitment and \\nenablement are now in line or above high-performing global companies. \\nCommitment increased year-on-year from 66% (2019) to 74% (2020) with colleagues telling us they are proud to work for DWS, \\nthat they would recommend the firm to family and friends and that working here motivates them to go over and above \\nexpectations. \\nEnablement has also reached a record high of 77% (2019: 69%) with significant increases in the number of colleagues telling us \\nthat their working conditions allow them to be more productive and that barriers  – previously hindering them – have been \\nremoved. \\nAdditionally, matching feedback with actions has also boosted trust and confidence in senior management with 78% of \\nemployees (2019: 71%) affirming the empowerment and effectiveness of managers in areas such as performance recognition, \\ndevelopment, ethics, integrity and consistent action.  \\nCOVID-19 has been a catalyst for new ways of working to give and receive feedback, “Speak Up”, show greater appreciation to \\none another and to facilitate effective team meetings. It has also resulted in managers and employees talking more frequently, \\nshowing care and attention, linking values with achievements and tackling key weaknesses from previous years such as \\naddressing underperformance and the speed of decision making. \\nCollaboration with the GLT and OpCo \\nTo further strengthen decision making and implementation, the DWS Executive Board is now complemented by two additional \\ngroups. The newly formed Global Leadership Team (GLT) is responsible for discussing growth opportunities, holistically \\nreviewing and inputting into the firm’s strategy, an d ensuring effective execution throughout the organisation. \\nAdditionally, the Global Operating Council (OpCo), as constituted at the beginning of 2019, operationally implements the \\ndecisions and priorities of the Executive Board and GLT in a collaborative manner across the firm. While the Executive Board \\nremains the ultimate decision-making body, the GLT and the Global OpCo prepare and implement these decisions.  \\nWorkforce trends \\nAs we continue on our path as a standalone, publicly-listed asset manager notable progress has been made across the following \\nareas: \\n−Embedding a performance-driven culture: the DWS-specific Functional Role Framework has been developed to lay a new\\nfoundation in how we work together. Additionally, new opportunities have been created to broaden skill-sets, networks and\\nexperiences – to do this we have supported various internal mobility initiatives, including identifying a number of temporary\\nopportunities across a range of Chief Operating Office roles in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate the agility of\\nour business.\\n−Prioritising the health and wellbeing of our employees. All have their own unique circumstances they are trying to manage\\nduring the pandemic – from living alone or being separated from their family, home-schooling their children, or taking care of\\nelderly parents and relatives. As a result, we established a DWS Wellbeing Microsite and ran multiple events across our\\nregions to share guidance and support.\\n\\n−Thinking more innovatively and further investing in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to better\\nunderstand our client needs. We have also modernised our technology through the introduction of a market-leading, cloud\\nbased HR platform Workday. As we look to the future, the implementation of the firm’s core platform transformation and\\n\\nremoving the dependency on Deutsche Bank’s technology infrastructure by transforming the firm into a digital asset manager.\\n\\n−Embedding sustainable people management and diversity and inclusion into everything we do. This is vital in attracting,\\ndeveloping, engaging and mobilising colleagues across the firm and to invest in their personal growth  – both individually and\\ncollectively. Shaping then firm’s culture and strategy from the next generation’s perspective by capturing their insights,\\nknowledge and expertise across different topics – this has been the driving force behind the establishment of the DWS\\nNextGen Advisory Group who partner with the DWS Executive Board as well as regional and divisional leadership teams.

These complemented the digital curriculum introduced in 2017 which offers \\na broad variety of learning materials, videos, podcasts and eLearning. Traditional classroom training was converted into virtual \\nsolutions to enable participation.\\nESG-related training was also a key focus. Taking into account different needs of the business, the offering covers a wide range \\nof solutions including awareness sessions, delivered internally but also leveraging existing online trainings, to certification. 60 \\nDWS employees have passed the Certified ESG Analyst (CESGA) exam in 2020, in addition to the 175 employees that were \\ncertified in 2018/19. \\nThe general objective of this training is to reinforce the importance of ESG issues in investment processes and to ensure \\ncolleagues understand the impact on risk and return from various angles; systemisation of different ESG investment approaches \\nand strategies; the market drivers for further ESG integration; responsible investing across asset classes; integration into \\nvaluation models; and different ESG reporting standards. \\nGraduates \\nWe remain fully committed to hiring graduates as our leaders of the future. They contribute to our agenda of change, \\nsustainability, reflect our future clients, and the diversity of our organisation. In 2020, we hired 23 graduates (2019: 29). \\nThis year we ran two separate orientation and training programmes  – one for DWS’s Technology cohort and another for the \\nremaining graduates, as in previous years. Since an in-person training in London was not possible given the COVID-19 \\npandemic, intensive education on the asset management industry was converted into a virtual training broken up into digestible \\nslots to accommodate learning preferences and time zones. \\nFurthermore, a new group project was introduced. Graduates collaborated in virtual teams to produce an innovative idea to solve \\none of the three UN Sustainable Development Goals that DWS has chosen in line with our ESG strategy. The final \\nrecommendations were presented to members of the DWS Executive Board and GLT with elements of each being taken forward \\nfor further consideration and implementation. \\nVocational training and dual studies are still an important component of our junior employee strategy and offer an additional \\nopportunity, particularly in Germany, to attract young talent to our company. In 2020, we hired two new vocational trainees (2019: \\n4). This brings the total number of Vocational Training/Dual Students up to 13 overall (2017 through 2020). \\nLeadership development \\nOur Leadership Capability Model defines what we expect from our leaders, as well as highlighting the capabilities needed to lead \\nemployees in line with our strategy and culture in the digital age. \\nAs a result of COVID-19 development topics on leading remote teams were accelerated. Partnering with Deutsche Bank, \\nmanagers at DWS were able to utilize a variety of these with a combination of digital and virtual offerings. The DWS talent and \\ndevelopment team also offered customised virtual training sessions to foster a culture of speak up and shared tips and tools to \\nsupport remote ways of working. \\nFirst-time leaders remain a key focus for the firm and we supported their growth into new roles (or helped them to acclimatize to \\nour leadership philosophy when hired from outside the organisation). To this end the “Welcome to Leadership” guide, was \\nformally rolled out in DWS in 2020. \\nIn addition, 519 managers (approx. 59%) across the firm attended specific “Doing what is right, not just what is allowed” training \\nsessions which focused on ethical decision making and highlighted possible pitfalls and grey areas to be mindful of if they do not \\nexercise good judgement and appropriate behaviour. To further emphasize the importance of feedback, DWS Learning Insights \\non “Meaningful conversations and feedback” were hosted for managers and employees.  \\nFurthermore, we started to implement Transition Coaching for senior managers moving into broader/more complex leadership \\nroles as well as those joining the firm externally. Internal HR coaches were able to provide support for six to nine months a nd \\noffer appropriate leadership tools to help new joiners acclimatize to the organisation.  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n People Strategy\\n  \\nand Attractive Employer\\n  \\n\\n106\\n \\nTalent progression \\nTalent acceleration programmes at Deutsche Bank, of which DWS benefited in the past, were postponed. In 2020 DWS chose a \\nmore individualised approach supporting career progression with targeted interventions and stretch assignments for key \\nemployees identified in the annual employee reviews. \\nVery early into the COVID-19 pandemic, critical roles and respective succession pipelines were identified. Later on the focus \\nshifted to employees with leadership and/or change enabler potential as well as our female pipeline for broader/more complex \\nroles. \\nThe Executive Board also identified key talent qualities and competencies that we intend to foster and grow in the coming years \\nby implementing a DWS talent programme. \\nExecutive Board members and senior managers also continue to host regular DWS Executive Talks to become familiar with our \\ntalent pipeline and to discuss matters of importance for DWS and its employees. These sessions are highly appreciated and are \\nnow an integral part of our talent development. \\nRemuneration strategy \\n[GRI 102-35] \\nRemuneration plays an integral role in the successful delivery of DWS’s strategic objectives. DWS compensation philosophy is \\nunderpinned by regulatory considerations and is predicated on the principles of “pay for performance”, “equal & fair pay”, “align-\\nment to DWS Shareholders and Investors”, and “enhanced alignment to asset management market practices”, with an aim to \\nsupport sustainable performance for a global, multi-asset firm. \\nIn the course of 2019/2020, our compensation framework and governance evolved in the following ways: \\n−In line with DWS Group status as a listed company and increased level of operational independence, DWS further\\nstrengthened its compensation governance framework by creating several stand-alone DWS compensation governance\\ncommittees following transfer of responsibilities from DB Group, primary among these were formation of:\\n–DWS Integrity Review Committee (IRC), as a delegated body of DWS Compensation Committee (DCC): to review and\\nmake suspension and forfeiture decisions involving DWS deferred awards, and oversee governance for DWS employee\\nconduct incidents\\n–DWS Pensions Working Group (PWG), as a delegated body of DWS Risk and Control Committee (RCC): to exercise DWS\\npension related responsibilities, and ensure appropriate engagement protocol with DB Group Pension Risk Committee\\n−DWS compensation structures are designed to provide mechanisms that promote and support long-term performance of the\\nDWS franchise and its employees. As part of DB Group, DWS has a long history of deferring part of variable compensation for\\nselect employees. The 2019 deferrals for DWS employees were delivered in DWS share based deferred equity awards  – DWS\\nRestricted Equity Award (REA), stand-alone DWS Restricted Incentive (Cash) Plan and DWS Fund-linked Employee\\nInvestment Plan (EIP). DWS continues to enhance these compensation plans.\\n−For performance year 2020, the Group component of Variable Compensation (GVC) for majority of DWS population is\\npredominantly determined based on the performance of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the DWS Group level. For\\nemployees at MD & D level, the Group Component additionally considers Key Performance Indicators at DB Group level. This\\nrepresents a transitional step towards becoming a standalone asset manager, and underscores the performance-driven culture\\nwhere compensation is aligned to appropriate DWS metrics reflecting DWS targets.\\n−In 2018, following the DWS Group IPO, all DWS employees were granted awards aimed at further aligning incentives to the\\nperformance of the firm. These included Share Appreciation Rights (SARs), which allow employees to benefit from the growth\\nin value of DWS over time. As of financial year-ending 2019, DWS has satisfied all performance conditions attached to this\\naward. The majority of staff employees will have an opportunity to exercise these awards from June 2021 to May 2025, with\\nlonger vesting periods applicable Material Risk Takers (MRTs).\\nDiversity & Equal Opportunities \\n[GRI 405-1] \\nAs a global organisation, DWS is committed to an inclusive culture that respects and embraces the diversity of our employees, \\nclients, and communities. As diversity and inclusion are central to the firm’s culture, our continuous focus is to:  \\n−build talented and diverse teams to drive business results\\n−create a respectful and inclusive environment where people can thrive\\n−strengthen our relationship with clients, partners, regulators, communities, and potential employees. DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n People Strategy\\n  \\nand Attractive Employer\\n  \\n\\n107\\n \\nWe aim to attract, develop, and retain the best people from all cultures, countries, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, \\nabilities, beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. To this end, and to prepare for opportunities and challenges arising from \\nchanging demographics, digitalization, and the future of work, we follow an integrated and multi-dimensional approach to diversity \\nand inclusion. We also aim at giving equal opportunities to employees who work both full-time and part time. This year the \\npercentage of employees globally who work part time stood at 8.8% (2019: 11.8%). \\nThroughout 2020, DWS continued its journey to embed diversity and inclusion in our business and people practices. Key focus \\nareas in 2020 were: \\n−Progressing our commitment to improve gender diversity. DWS set voluntary goals at the Supervisory Board and Executive\\nBoard-1 and Executive Board-2 levels per the German Gender Quota Law in 2019. Gender diversity is one of the KPIs that we\\nare tracking internally with continued success in meeting our voluntary goals.\\n−Improving diversity through talent attraction: Embedding diversity into the renewed Employee Value Proposition which will be\\nimplemented in 2021, targeted campaigns to attract more diverse talent, and projects to attract and retain people across\\ngenerations.\\n−Strengthening cross-generational collaboration and contribution: Creation of the DWS NextGen Advisory Group ESG taskforce\\nto further the partnership and input across the population on key strategic initiatives for DWS.\\n−Focus on diversity beyond gender across our organisation to include organisational learning, a development programme for\\nBlack VP talent in the Americas, signing up to support the #100black interns initiative as well as establishing a Black\\nLeadership Alliance initiative in the UK, and the creation of DWS specific Employee Inclusion Networks (EINs) and an\\nEmployee Inclusion Engagement Council of senior leaders leads to further our progress in building a diverse and inclusive\\nculture.\\n−Launching a new “We are DWS” campaign to highlight the contribution s and achievements of employees inside and outside of\\nour firm – how they have given back to society and to our local communities, as well as the convictions they stand up for.\\nArticles have resonated very well internally as well as on the firm’s social me dia channels with topics including LGBTQI,\\nMentoring, Black Lives Matter, Gender Diversity and CSR volunteering.\\nContinuing our focus on gender diversity \\nThe percentage of women on the Supervisory Board was 33.3% at the end of the year (2019: 36%), which met the statutory \\nrequirement of 30% for listed and co-determined German companies under gender quota legislation. \\nAs of year-end 2020, 27% of the executive positions at the first management level below the Executive Board were held by \\nexecutive women (2019: 21.5%). At the second level below the Executive Board, this percentage stood at 28.2% (2019: 26.8%). \\nIn accordance with the legal requirement in Germany, DWS set targets for December 31, 2021, of 26% and 29%, respectively. \\nWe have aspirations for greater female representation at DWS and continue to monitor and report on our progress to the \\nExecutive Board. We have a variety of measures in place including talent development programmes, manager training, best \\npractices on people-related decisions, internal monitoring, and significant support for grassroots, employee-driven initiatives. \\nSpecific actions linked to increasing diversity in decision making bodies which include voting committees, legal entity boards and \\nwider governance bodies has supported our continued success. DWS hosted gender diversity group discussions in both UK and \\nGermany covering every corporate level to obtain feedback and receive recommendations to drive improvement. We believe \\nimproved gender balance in leadership roles will meaningfully contribute to the future success of DWS. \\nIn the UK, Deutsche Bank published its third Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap report in compliance with UK legislation that came \\ninto force in April 2017, requiring all companies with 250 or more employees to report their gender pay gap annually. DWS was \\nincluded in this data. For the first time the Firm will declare Ethnicity data on the 2021 report. \\nIn Germany, the German Remuneration Transparency Act, which came into force in January 2018, offers employees the right to \\nrequest specific aggregated information about the remuneration of colleagues of the opposite gender in comparable jobs. As a \\nglobal company, we continue to look forward to monitoring and reporting on our progress. \\nIn December the firm was shortlisted in Citywire’s Gender Diversity Awards 2020 (in the category “most improved in gender \\ndiversity”), which recognises the progress made by fund management groups and their gender diversity practices.  \\nCreating an inclusive work environment \\nEmployee Inclusion Networks (EINs) were founded in the US in 2020 which are central to our D&I work. EINs unite colleagues \\nfrom different backgrounds, experiences, and business areas to inspire inclusiveness in our daily interactions. They are voluntary, \\nemployee-led groups, driven by a common purpose: making a better workplace  – for everyone. By sharing information, \\neducating, and engaging with our communities, EINs contribute to business development as well as recruitment, retention, and  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n People Strategy\\n  \\nand Attractive Employer\\n  \\n\\n108\\n \\nprofessional development. They are open to all employees; allies who do not self-identify with a particular group are welcome. \\nOur EINs support the advancement of the following communities: differently-abled, generations, LGBTQI, Asian, Latin, Black, \\nveterans, and women.

Providing \\nleadership throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has been a top priority in helping to steer the organisation and to support \\nemployees. \\nWorking from home \\nIn Q2 2020 DWS ran a global survey on future ways of working to assess: pre-COVID working habits;  employees’ productivity \\nduring COVID; and post-COVID work preferences. 2,802 employees participated giving a response rate of 67%. \\nFindings demonstrated that grounds for concern – such as technology dependencies – were unfounded and as a result many \\nemployees gave a preference to work from home 2-3 days per week in the future. This was reflected across all business units, \\nregions, levels of seniority, and other survey demographics (e.g. gender, tenure, full / part-time). \\nThe survey also demonstrated a 92% favourable response from employees in being able to fully carry out their role working from \\nhome. \\nQuarterly Feedback Culture \\nIn addition, quarterly feedback culture surveys have been distributed to all global employees to track progress on five key areas \\nof focus: giving and receiving feedback, speaking up, showing appreciation, facilitating effective team meetings and to understand \\nhow well supported employees have felt through COVID-19.  \\nResults continue to reinforce the 2020 People Survey results with the  firm’s stance being highly appreciated throughout the \\npandemic. The COVID-19 related question “I feel supported by my manager in adapting to the changed environment and \\nchallenges posed by COVID-19” scored 90% positive.  \\nWith almost 1.000 free text comments received, many also particularly appreciated how managers had become more flexible and \\naccommodating on working hours, were communicating on a more frequent basis, and how they were placing greater trust in \\ntheir colleagues.

With so many people in \\nDWS working from home, the evidence shows that this has not hindered our ability to maintain open two-way conversations as a \\nteam, to draw on each other’s knowledge, skills and perspectives to solve problems and to achieve a team’s collective goals.  \\nContinuing to support managers and employees through COVID- 19 \\nDWS is partnering with a global leadership development consultancy with expertise in developing healthy, performing \\norganisations to deliver intensive learning events on employee wellbeing and managing virtual teams which will be accompanied \\nby smaller “reflection circles” over the coming months. The first three pilot sessions were run in December 2020 an d the \\nremainder will run until March 2021. \\nOver 400 managers will be invited to attend these events to provide managers with knowledge, tools and tips on managing a \\nremote team and support wellbeing within the organisation. There will be space for managers to reflect on their own experiences, \\nas well as to share, support and learn from others. It will also be an opportunity to build a support network that spans the \\norganisation and extends beyond the sessions themselves. \\nAdditionally, managers and employees have been further supported through the following: \\n−Within the UK and APAC, manager training sessions were held in Q4 to provide people managers with practical tips and\\nadvice on how to continue to support wellbeing and to spot signs of mental health issues as employees continue to work from\\nhome.\\n−DWS has maintained active and regular communication with its employees via a series of articles and videos from our CEO\\nand employees across all levels of seniority explaining how they have adapted  – whether they are working at home in\\nisolation, separated from family, home-schooling their children or taking care of elderly family and relatives.\\n−A DWS Wellbeing microsite, containing a repository of information including webinars and podcasts, across all regions\\nsignposts the wellbeing, mental health and flexible working support available.

The focus of our CSR dedication  is therefore on \\nthe following two goals, which we are working to achieve: Combating climate change and achieving greater social justice \\n(reducing inequalities). \\nWhen making donations, we follow our internal guidelines. The Head of CSR as well as the Global Head of Communications & \\nMarketing at DWS are responsible for decisions in coordination with the DWS Executive Board. \\nOur Social Engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic  \\nFor the first time since our IPO – and therefore as an independent asset manager – we have implemented a DWS-owned aid \\nprogramme, to give back to the community and help feed those in need. \\nCOVID-19 has shown significant effects on the global food situation. As such, the majority of our approximately EUR 1 million \\ncorporate donation was shared among charities that have been specifically set up to prevent hunger, helping to feed thousands of  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Responsibility \\n around our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Tax Policy\\n \\n\\n110\\n \\nhungry people across India, Germany, Spain, the US and the UK. These charities include Acción Contra el Hambre (Action \\nAgainst Hunger, Spain), The Akshaya Patra Foundation (in India), Feeding Britain, Feeding America, as well as the German food \\nbanks “Tafel Frankfurt”, “Tafel Berlin” and ”Tafel Cologne”. Another major donation was made in Germany to the children’s aid \\norganization “Die Arche” (the Ark).   \\nIn addition, the donations we have made are not only being used to support the most vulnerable during the pandemic, but to also \\nfund longer-term solutions so that we can prevent chronic hunger in the future. For example, our donations have been used to \\nbuild a bakery at a refugee camp in Syria and to provide hygienic care for children and their families at a further refugee camp \\nthere, as well as to assist an organization in London, who run a dedicated bus, which provides food to low income families. I n \\nFrankfurt we have financed a refrigerated vehicle, which allows collection and delivery of fresh and healthy food to vulnerable \\npeople, and in Berlin we have financed a cold storage cell for the local food bank. \\nDWS is also helping to fund “The Global Health Research Accelerator”, a social enterprise launched by The Global Health \\nNetwork and the University of Oxford that help set up and conduct critical research in tackling and preventing epidemics and \\ndiseases affecting impoverished communities in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  \\nIn order to show our commitment as a firm and to achieve an impact, we have also encouraged our employees to make \\ndonations to these organizations.  \\nProtection of the oceans \\nIn addition to our social commitment, we focus on ecological issues and we want to actively contribute to the fight against climate \\nchange. This is why we are already in our second year of supporting the marine protection organization, Healthy Seas, which was \\nfounded in 2013 and has set itself the task of tackling the  “ghost fishing” phenomenon, which is responsible for the needless \\ndeath of marine animals.  \\nGhost fishing is where abandoned nets, which have been left or lost by fishing boats, damage marine habitats and  \\n‘continue to \\nfish’ as they can be nearly invisible to many creatures . Through clean-ups with volunteer divers and by working towards marine \\nlitter prevention with stakeholders from the fishing sector, Healthy Seas collects waste nets and ensures they are  recycled to \\nmake something more useful. \\nThe fishing industry plays an important role in contributing to CO 2 reduction and therefore, climate change mitigation. The \\nactivities of Healthy Seas are directly focused on marine protection, circular economy, plastic pollution education and prevention \\nof biodiversity loss – which all have a positive impact on climate change.  \\nLooking ahead \\nThese aid programmes for charitable organizations are the beginning of our social commitment as a stand-alone Asset Manager. \\nWe will continue to expand on this and also offer our employees the opportunity to actively participate through corporate \\nvolunteering. In doing so, we will focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations (UN) in \\norder to give the necessary weight to the focus on ESG, which is important for us from a holistic corporate perspective. \\nTax Policy \\n[GRI 207-1] \\n\\nDWS tax policy framework is part of Deutsche Bank’s tax strategy and principles\\n 57\\n. These principles are embedded in controls, \\napply to all our entities and have been approved by the Management Board of Deutsche Bank. They enable us to manage our tax \\naffairs in a way which aims to ensure that the tax consequences of business operations are appropriately aligned with the \\neconomic, regulatory and commercial consequences of those business operations, with due regard being given to the potential \\nperspective of the relevant tax authorities. These tax principles also help to make our interactions with tax authorities proactive, \\ntransparent, courteous, and timely. We constantly seek to foster positive working relationships with tax authorities. \\n\\nDuring 2020 an area of significant focus was the EU’s mandatory tax disclosure directive known as DAC6 requiring EU member \\nstates to introduce tax reporting obligations for taxpayers and intermediaries in relation to cross-border arrangements containing \\n\\n57\\n For additional information please see https://www.db.com/ir/en/tax-strategy.htm  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\n[Respons\\nibility \\naround our Fiduciary Value Chain]\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Tax Policy\\n \\n\\n111\\n \\nspecified tax hallmarks. Reporting obligations for Germany became applicable from July 1, 2020 (including for a look back period \\nto June 25, 2018); most other EU member states applied a six months deferral provision introduced to accommodate disruptions \\narising from COVID-19. DWS has evaluated its products and services against DAC6’s reporting requirements, taking into account \\nadministrative guidance where available, and has introduced processes to ensure continuing compliance. \\nRisk management and governance \\nThe management, control and reporting of tax risks follows the three lines of defence model. \\nThe first line of defence are our business divisions whose activities may generate tax risks. The business divisions are \\nresponsible for managing tax risks within the defined tax risk appetite at the appropriate granularity. This is to ensure tha t \\norganization, governance and structures are in place to identify, monitor, and evaluate the tax risks they generate or are exposed \\nto. \\nThe second line of defence is the tax function which facilitates the implementation of a sound tax risk management framework to \\nensure that DWS Group’s position, with respect to tax m atters, remains robust. The tax function, which is independent of the \\nbusiness divisions, is responsible for defining the tax risk appetite as well as the tax risk management and control standards. It \\nalso independently oversees and challenges the business es’ and management and acquiring of tax risks.  \\nThe third line of defence is our internal audit function which is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on \\nthe effectiveness of how the business divisions and the tax function interact with respect to tax risk management.  \\nPreventing infringements \\nWe have in place controls and other governance mechanisms to ensure, in all material aspects, that we comply with applicable \\ntax laws, file accurate tax returns, and pay the amount of tax due. \\nTax evasion is illegal and goes against our culture, values and beliefs. Applicable policies strictly prohibit aiding or abetting it. We \\nadvocate the adoption of robust laws and regulations to combat financial crime, including tax evasion, and do not endorse actions \\nthat seek to undermine tax reporting of financial account information under applicable legislation, such as the Common Reporting \\nStandard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). These requirements are also intended to prevent u s \\nfrom committing or facilitating - intentionally or negligently - criminal offences.

As such, it is responsible for the management of the \\nbusiness of the DWS KGaA. The Shareholders’ Meeting of the General Partner is responsible for the compensation strategy of \\nthe Executive Board of DWS Management GmbH as well as for determining their level and structure of compensation. Th e \\nvariable compensation of each Executive Board member is concluded by the Shareholders’ Meeting of the General Partner \\nbased on a proposal from the Joint Committee of DWS KGaA. The Joint Committee currently consists of two members delegated \\nby the Shareholders’ Meeting of the General Partner (two members of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank) and two \\nexternal members delegated by the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. \\nExecutive Board members with responsibility for the Investment, Coverage and Product business have, in addition to their service \\ncontracts with DWS Management GmbH, an additional service contract with a subsidiary of the Group. The Shareholders’ \\nMeeting of the General Partner is solely responsible for the compensation policy and individual compensation relating to DWS \\nManagement GmbH. Accordingly, the Executive Board compensation report focuses on the compensation policy and the system \\napplicable to the Executive Board members in their role as Executive Board members of DWS Management GmbH. However and \\nfor reasons of transparency, the total compensation of the Executive Board members include both the compensation received \\nfrom DWS Management GmbH as well as from subsidiaries of the Group consolidated in the Group financial statements. \\nCompensation System \\nThe Executive Board of DWS Management GmbH is responsible for the steering and oversight of the entire the Group and \\ncontributes to the long-term success of the Group. The Executive Board therefore requires an appropriate compensation system \\nto support sustainable corporate development in line with the shareholders interest. The results and successes within the \\ncomparative environment are also taken into account. \\nWhen structuring the compensation system and determining individual compensation, various factors have been taken into \\naccount: \\nDWS Group Strategy: The strategy of the Group forms the basis for the definition of the objectives. The degree of achievement \\nof these objectives determines the level of compensation. \\nSustainability: Long-term objectives and performance parameters as well as variable compensation granted on a deferral basis \\nguarantee sustainable work on further success and business development. \\nShareholder Value: Clearly defined key financials directly linked to the performance of the Group are the basis of the defined \\ncompensation and therefore ensure a close link between the interest of both the shareholders and the Executive Board members. \\nCompliance:  The  structure of  the  system  and  the  determination  of  the  individual compensation  comply  with  all statutory  and \\nregulatory requirements. \\nMotivation: Ambitious and motivating individual objectives and appropriate consideration of the responsibilities and duties of the \\nindividual and of the Executive Board as a whole support a successful and dynamic environment. \\nCustomary and competitiveness:  When designing the structure, a compensation package is offered that is competitive and in \\nline  with  the  peer  environment  which  means  in  particular  international  Asset  Managers  comparable  in  terms  of  assets  under \\nmanagement and number of employees as well as listed companies in Germany comparable in terms of market capitalization. \\nFollowing the requirements of the German Remuneration Ordinance of Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung - InstVV) the \\nmembers of the Executive Board have been identified as Deutsche Bank Group Material Risk Takers (InstVV MRTs) and as \\nAIFMD/UCITS V Material Risk Takers (AIFMD/UCITS V MRTs) following their responsibilities for the management companies in \\nthe Group subject to the EU Directives on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMD) and Undertakings for Collective \\nInvestment in Transferable Securities V (UCITS V). Remuneration provisions stipulated in these regimes have been considered \\nwhen passing resolutions on the structure and determination of compensation.

It amounts \\nto € 2,400,000 per year for the Chairman of the Executive Board and between €  950,000 and € 1,250,000 per year for the other \\nExecutive Board members. It is paid in twelve equal monthly instalments. \\nFurthermore, all Executive Board Members are entitled to additional benefits. They consist of contributions to insurance policies, \\nparticipation in medical check-ups and – for Executive Board members based in Germany – a company car option on the basis of \\nthe applicable Company Car Policy of Deutsche Bank Group. The availability and individual utilization of these additional benefits \\nmay vary by location and individual circumstances. \\nIn addition, the Executive Board members receive an annual contribution to a defined contribution pension plan. Every year an d \\nfor full-time employment, an amount of € 90,000 – based on a fiscal year – is paid into the Pension Plan (annual contribution). \\nThe annual contribution is invested in selected investment funds. Furthermore, an additional risk contribution of €  10,000 is \\nprovided annually to cover premature pension cases. The sum of the market values of the investments form the pension amount \\navailable to be paid as pension benefit in case of a pension event (age limit, disability or death). Executive Board members \\noutside Germany receive a pension allowance up to a maximum amount of €  90,000 – based on a fiscal year - instead of the \\npension plan commitment.\\nPerformance-related component \\nThe entire variable compensation (VC) is performance-related. \\nThe variable performance-related compensation is linked to previously defined and agreed quantitative and qualitative objectives. \\nThe objectives are established at the beginning of a financial year by the Shareholders´ Meeting of the General Partner as \\nstarting point of the annual objective setting process. At year end, the level of achievement of each objective is determined based \\non the assessment of financial figures and/or other assessment criteria. \\nThe following performance parameters play a key role in measuring performance: \\n−the individual contribution of each Executive Board member,\\n−the results of the relevant business unit,\\n−the business development of the Group,\\n−and the business development of Deutsche Bank Group.\\nThe performance-related compensation consists of the following two components: \\nShort-Term Award (STA) \\nThe performance criteria of the STA consist of collective and individual objectives. These can be short-term objectives related to \\nthe year as well as interim targets for actually long-term oriented objectives. \\nCollective Objectives \\nDue to regulatory requirements, the overall performance of Deutsche Bank Group must also be taken into account when \\ndetermining the variable compensation. For this reason, collective objectives are linked to the Deutsche Bank Group strategy  and \\nperformance. In accordance with this strategy, four performance metrics constituting important indicators for the capital, risk, cost \\nand return profile of Deutsche Bank form the reference value for the Deutsche Bank Group component of the STA: \\n−Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital ratio (fully loaded):  The Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio of Deutsche Bank in relation to\\nrisk-weighted assets.\\n−Leverage ratio: Deutsche Bank’s Tier 1 capital as a percentage of its total leverage exposure pursuant in line with\\nCRR/CRD IV.\\n−Adjusted costs: Total noninterest expenses, excluding restructuring and severance, litigation, impairment of goodwill and\\nother intangibles of Deutsche Bank.

The latter is the shareholders’ equity on Deutsche Bank’s balance sheet, excludin g\\ngoodwill and other intangible assets.\\nThe four objectives above are equally weighted at 25% of the target figure for the Deutsche Bank Group component of the STA. \\nThe Deutsche Bank Group component constitutes a portion of 10% of the total variable compensation. \\nIndividual Objectives \\nIn addition, the STA rewards the achievement of individual objectives. These objectives are c oncluded by the Shareholders’ \\nMeeting of the General Partner as part of the annual objective setting process for the respective financial year. The objectives are \\ndesigned to contribute to the overall strategy of the Group but also focus on the respective area of responsibility of each \\nExecutive Board member. Corresponding assessment criteria are set for all individual objectives to enable the Joint Committee to \\nprepare proposals and the Shareholders’ Meeting of the General Partner to finally resolve the ac hievement level of each \\nobjective.  \\nSince 2019, the Balanced Scorecard has been integrated in the compensation system of the individual component of the STA by \\ndetermining the achievement level for a portion of the individual component of the STA taking into account the results of specified \\nkey performance indicators. The Balanced Scorecard allows for the operationalization of strategic objectives by transforming the \\nlatter into measurable targets, while simultaneously creating an overview of priorities across the Group. The Balanced Scorecard \\ncontains key financial metrics as well as (non-financial) key performance indicators. In order to link the Balanced Scorecard to the \\ncompensation of the Executive Board members, the Shareholders’ Meeting of the General  Partner resolved that the individual \\ncomponent of the STA comprising the key performance indicator will be accounted for in the performance evaluation of the \\nExecutive Board members with a ratio of 60%. \\nThe sum of the individual objectives and the Balanced Scorecard amounts to 50% of the target figure of the total variable \\ncompensation. \\nLong-Term Award (LTA) \\nThe LTA consists of the DWS Group component linked to the achievement of long-term collective objectives. In accordance with \\nthe strategy of the Group, four selected performance measures constituting important indicators for the performance, cash \\ngeneration capacity and the growth of the business and brand of DWS form the reference value for the DWS Group component \\nfor the financial year 2020: \\n−Adjusted Cost-Income ratio (CIR)\\n−Net flows Assets under Management (AuM)\\n−Dividend payout ratio\\n−Environment Social and Governance (ESG) footprint\\nDetailed information on the Key Performance Indicators and the successes in the area of ESG can be found in the chapter \\n‘Operating and Financial Review – DWS Performance’ and in the chapter ‘Operating and Financial Review –  Overview of 2020’. \\nEach of the above four objectives is weighted at a fixed percentage of the target figure for the Group component. This target \\nfigure amounts to 40% of the total variable compensation. \\nMaximum Compensation \\nThe total compensation of an Executive Board member is subject to additional caps. Due to regulatory requirements, the variab le \\ncompensation is capped at 200% of the fixed compensation . In addition, the Shareholders’ Meeting of the General Partner set a \\ncap of € 9.85 million for the overall total compensation for the 2020 financial year.

Not less than half of this deferred portion must comprise equity-based compensation components, \\nwhile the remaining portion might be granted as deferred cash compensation. Both compensation components must be deferred \\nover a multi-year period which, for the equity-based compensation components, must be followed by a retention period. During \\nthe period until payments, the compensation portions awarded on a deferred basis may be forfeited. At least half of the non-\\ndeferred portion must also consist of equity-based compensation components and only the remaining portion may be paid out \\ndirectly in cash. Of the total variable compensation, no more than a maximum of 20% may be paid out in cash immediately, while \\nat least 80% are paid at a later date. \\n\\nShort\\n-\\nTerm\\n \\n\\nAward \\n\\n \\n(STA) \\n\\n\\nLong\\n-\\nTerm \\n\\nAward \\n\\n(LTA) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nCompensation Report\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Executive Board\\n  \\nCompensation\\n  \\n\\n116\\n \\nOverview on Award Types \\n\\nAward Type\\n \\nDescription\\n \\nDeferral Period\\n \\nRetention Period\\n \\nProportion\\n \\n\\nCash VC\\n \\nUpfront cash proportion\\n \\nN/A\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n50% of the upfront \\nVC\\n \\n\\nDWS Equity Upfront Award\\n \\n\\n(DWS EUA)\\n \\nUpfront equity proportion (cash settled): The value \\n\\nof the EUA is linked to DWS\\'s share price\\n \\n \\nN/A\\n \\n12 months\\n \\n50% of the upfront VC\\n \\n\\nDWS Restricted Incentive Award\\n \\n\\n(DWS RIA)\\n \\nNon\\n-\\nequity based portion (deferred cash \\ncompen-\\n\\nsation)\\n \\n\\nThe Executive Board members can also elect to \\n\\nlink all or part of the value of the RIA to selected \\n\\nDWS investment fund(s), in which case the \\n\\nAwards will be granted under the “DWS Employee \\n\\nInvestment Plan \\n-\\n \\nElected EIP Award”\\n \\n \\nPro rata vesting\\n \\nover five \\n\\nyears\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n50% of deferred VC\\n \\n\\nDWS Restricted Equity Award\\n \\n\\n(DWS REA)\\n \\nDeferred equity portion (cash settled): The value \\n\\nof the REA is linked to DWS\\'s share price over the \\n\\nvesting and retention period\\n \\n \\nPro rata vesting over five \\n\\nyears\\n \\n12 months\\n \\n50% of deferred VC\\n \\n\\nThe DWS Restricted Incentive Awards as well as the DWS Restricted Equity Awards vest in equal tranches over a period of five \\nyears. Each tranche of the DWS Equity Award is subject to an additional retention period of one year after vesting. During the \\ndeferral and retention period, the value of the Restricted Equity Awards is linked to the DWS share price and is therefore tied to \\nthe sustained performance of the Group. Specific forfeiture provisions apply for DWS Restricted Incentive Awards and DWS \\nRestricted Equity Awards during the deferral and retention period. \\nOne-off IPO related awards were granted as DWS Performance Share Unit-Award (PSU-Award) under the DWS Equity Plan. The \\nDWS Equity Plan is a phantom share plan representing a contingent right to receive a cash payment by referencing to the value \\nof DWS Shares during a specified period of time. The award and the number of units are subject to the achievement of pre-\\ndefined targets (Average Net flows and Adjusted CIR (Cost Income Ratio). The Awards vest in equal tranches over a determined \\nperiod of time and each Tranche is subject to an additional retention period of one year after vesting. \\nForfeiture Conditions / Clawback Provisions \\nAs some of the compensation components are deferred or spread out over several years (Restricted Incentive Awards and \\nRestricted Equity Awards) certain forfeiture conditions are applicable until vesting or the end of the retention periods, in order to \\ncreate a long-term incentive. Awards may be fully or partially forfeited, for example, due to individual misconduct (including a \\nbreach of regulations) or termination for cause, and also due to a negative Group result or individual negative contributions to \\nresults. In addition, the Awards will be forfeited completely if minimum requirements for the core capital ratio or for the capital \\nadequacy ratio of the Group are not met during defined periods. \\nIn addition, Deutsche Bank Group performance conditions\\n 58 apply to the awards following the InstVV MRT status of the members \\nof the Executive Board. Furthermore based on the InstVV regulation so-called “clawback provisions” are to be agreed with the \\nInstVV MRTs. Contrary to the forfeiture conditions, this clause allows the Shareholders’ Meeting of the  General Partner to reclaim \\nalready paid out variable compensation components in response to specific individual negative contributions to results made b y \\nthe Executive Board member. The clawback clauses have been agreed with the Executive Board members in their service \\ncontracts. \\n\\nOther Benefits upon Early Termination \\nThe Executive Board members are in principle entitled to receive a severance payment upon early termination of their \\nappointment at the initiative of the Shareholders´ Meeting of the General Partner, provided the Shareholders´ Meeting of the \\nGeneral Partner is not entitled to revoke the appointment or give notice under the contractual agreement for cause. The \\ncircumstances of the early termination of the appointment and the length of service on the Executive Board are to be taken into \\naccount when determining the amount of the severance payment. The severance payment, as a rule, is two annual compensation \\namounts and is limited to the claims to compensation for the remaining term of the contract. The calculation of the severance \\npayment is based on the annual compensation for the previous financial year and on the expected annual compensation for the \\ncurrent financial year, if applicable. The severance payment is determined in accordance with the statutory and regulatory \\nrequirements, in particular with the provisions of the InstVV. \\n\\n58\\n For further information on the DB Group performance conditions please refer to DB Group Annual Report.

On the basis of the termination agreements with DWS Management \\nGmbH, termination benefits in the amount of €  1,800,299 were agreed. \\nCompensation in accordance with the German Accounting Standard No. 17 (GAS 17) \\nIn accordance with the requirements of the GAS 17, the members of the Executive Board collectively received in the 2020 \\nfinancial year compensation totalling €  17,146,126 (2019: € 27,063,572). Of that, € 4,990,577 (2019: € 14,239,191) was for \\nequity-based components. \\nAmendment of the compensation system for the Executive Board as of January 1, 2021 \\nAgainst the background of new regulatory requirements according to the act transposing the second European Shareholder \\nRights Directive into German law (ARUG II) and the new German Corporate Governance Codex (GCGC 2020), the \\ncompensation system for the Executive Board was thoroughly reviewed and further developed. The changes to the compensation \\nsystem are to become effective as of January 1, 2021, for all current members of the Executive Board and will be submitted fo r \\napproval to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on June 9, 2021, in accordance with Section 120 a (1) of the German Stock \\nCorporation Act (AktG). A comprehensive explanation of the amendments to the compensation system for the Executive Board \\nwill be published with the invitation to the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.  \\nCompensation for Supervisory Board Members \\nThe compensation for members of the Supervisory Board is set forth in the Articles of Association of DWS KGaA. Any amend-\\nment of the Articles of Association requires a resolution of the General Meeting of DWS KGaA.  \\nThe members of the Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual compensation (“Supervisory Board Compensation”). The annual \\nbase compensation amounts to € 85,000 for each member, the Chairperson o f the Supervisory Board receives twice that amount \\nand the Deputy Chairperson one and a half times that amount.  \\nMembers and the Chairpersons of the Committees of the Supervisory Board are paid an additional fixed annual compensation as \\nfollows: \\n\\nin €\\n \\n Chairperson\\n \\nMember\\n \\n\\nAudit & Risk Committee\\n \\n 40,000\\n \\n20,000\\n \\n\\nNomination Committee\\n \\n 20,000\\n \\n15,000\\n \\n\\nRemuneration Committee\\n \\n 20,000\\n \\n15,000\\n \\nThe Supervisory Board Compensation is disbursed within the first three months of the following year. \\nIn case of a change in the composition of the Supervisory Board during the year, the compensation for the financial year will be \\npaid on a pro rata basis, rounded up / down to full months.  \\nThe current Supervisory Board Compensation was determined in 2018, prior to the IPO of DWS KGaA, with the support of an \\nindependent external remuneration advisor. It takes into account the tasks, scope of activities and time commitment of the \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board and is based on a horizontal peer group comparison. The peer group was composed of a \\ncluster of German listed companies with similar footprint, market cap and structure.  \\nThe Supervisory Board Compensation shall be regularly reviewed with the help of independent external experts. If the Managing \\nDirectors of the General Partner and the Supervisory Board see reason for change, they will submit a modified compensation  DWS \\n \\n1 \\n–\\n \\nSummarized Management Report\\n  \\nCompensation Report\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Compensation for\\n  \\nJoint Committee Members\\n  \\n\\n123\\n \\nsystem and a proposal for a corresponding amendment of the Articles of Association of DWS KGaA to the General Meeting. In \\nany case, the compensation for the Supervisory Board, including the underlying compensation system, will be presented to the \\nGeneral Meeting for its approval (“Billigung”) every four years. In case of a potential conflict of interest on the part of i ndividual \\nManaging Directors or members of the Supervisory Board with regard to the compensation system for the Supervisory Board, \\nsuch conflict will be treated in accordance with the existing policies and procedures. \\nDesigning the Supervisory Board Compensation as a pure fixed compensation without performance-related elements strengthens \\nthe Supervisory Board’s independence and provides for a meaningful counterweight to the strategy -aligned compensation system \\nfor the Executive Board, which includes both fixed and variable components. The Supervisory Board compensation thus \\ncontributes to the implementation of DWS KGaA’s corporate strategy and promotes its long -term development. \\nDWS KGaA reimburses the members of the Supervisory Board for the cash expenses they incur in the performance of their \\noffice, including any value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses. Furthermore, any employer \\ncontributions to social security schemes that may be applicable under foreign law to the performance of their work on the \\nSupervisory Board shall be paid for each member of the Supervisory Board affected.

The Group’s cash flow statement presented below is prepared using the indirect method for cash flows from operating \\nactivities. \\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \\nOperating activities cover mainly the commission and fee cash flows from customers as well as compensation and benefits and \\ngeneral and administrative expenses. In addition, operating activities include cash flows from other operating assets and liabilities \\non own account, which are excluded from investing and financing activities. Cash flows relating to trading assets and liabilities \\nand derivative financial instruments are also reported net in a separate item under operating activities.

Cash flows for paid dividends are allocated to financing \\nactivities, as these are related to equity. \\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \\nInvesting activities contain mainly cash flows resulting from purchase, sale and maturities of non-trading financial assets, financial \\nassets mandatory at fair value through other comprehensive income, tangible and intangible assets. Non-trading financial assets \\ninclude mainly government bonds, investments in money market funds and activities in co- and seed investments. Financial \\nassets mandatory at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise government bonds.

Accordingly, the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements have been \\nprepared on a going concern basis.  \\n\\n02 – Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates \\nBasis of Accounting \\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, Frankfurt (Frankfurt Regional Court, \\nHRB 111128), as of December 31, 2020, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards \\n(IFRSs) and the relevant interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and in \\ncompliance with Section 315a German Commercial Code and were approved by the Executive Board on March 5, 2021. \\nThe consolidated financial statements include DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA and its subsidiaries ( collectively the “Group/DWS \\nGroup”) are stated in euro, the presentation currency of the Group except when otherwise indicated and are rounded to the \\nnearest million. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this document may not add up precisely to the totals provided \\nand percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. “N/A” is read as not applicable.   \\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS ) \\nas issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union (EU). The Group’s \\napplication of IFRS results in no differences between IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as endorsed by the EU.  \\nDisclosures about the nature and the extent of risks arising from financial instruments as required by IFRS  7 “Financial \\nInstruments: disclosures” are set forth in the Risk Report section of the Summarized Management Report and are an integrated \\npart of the consolidated financial statements. These audited disclosures are identified by bracketing in the margins of the Risk \\nReport. \\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Critical Accounting Estimates \\nIn preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the principles underlying the consolidation procedures of \\nIFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” have been applied.   \\nThe financial information in the Consolidated Financial Statements includes the parent company, DWS Group GmbH & Co. \\nKGaA, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including certain structured entities presented as a single economic unit. The  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n134\\n \\nindividual financial statements of the companies included in the consolidation are drawn up on the same accounting date, \\nDecember 31, 2020, as that of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA.  \\nIn addition, management have made judgments and estimates that affects the application of the Group’s accounting policy and \\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to estimates are recognized \\nprospectively. \\nThe following accounting policies are important to the presentation of the Group’s reported amounts of income, expenses, asse ts, \\nliabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date and require the Group’s management\\'s most subjective \\nor complex judgments and the use of assumptions, often as a result of the need to estimate the effects of matters that are \\ninherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, \\nwhere applicable and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, uncertainty about these \\nassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset \\nor liability affected in the future. Management cannot offer any assurance that the actual results will be consistent with these \\nestimates and assumptions, and these critical accounting estimates or assumptions could change from period to period, or could \\ninvolve estimates where management could have reasonably used another estimate in the relevant accounting period. The most \\ncritical accounting policies, which reflect significant management estimates to determine amounts in the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements, are as follows: \\n−the impairment of associates (see ‘Associates’ below)\\n−the determination of fair value (see ‘Financial Assets and Liabilities, Financial Instruments’ below)\\n−the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles (see ‘Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets’ below)\\n−the accounting for legal and regulatory contingencies (see ‘Provisions’ below)\\n−the accounting for revenues under IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (see ‘Net Commissions and Fees from\\nAsset Management’ below)\\n−the accounting for leases under IFRS 16 “Leases” (see ‘Leases’ below)\\nSubsidiaries \\nThe Group’s subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control  over an entity is evidenced by the \\nGroup’s ability to exercise its power in order to affect any variable returns that the Group is exposed to through its involv ement \\nwith the entity.  \\nWhen assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the Group evaluates a range of control factors, namely: \\n−the purpose and design of the entity\\n−the relevant activities and how these are determined\\n−whether the Group’s rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities\\n−whether the Group has exposure or rights to variable returns\\n−whether the Group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns\\nWhere voting rights are relevant, the Group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or indirectly, more than half of the \\nvoting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant \\nactivities.  \\nPotential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control. Likewise, the Group also \\nassesses existence of control where it does not control the majority of the voting power but has the practical ability to unilaterally \\ndirect the relevant activities or its exposure to the variability of returns is different from that of other investors.  \\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date on \\nwhich control ceases.  \\nThe Group reassesses the consolidation status at least at every quarterly reporting date. Therefore, any changes in the structure \\nleading to a change in one or more of the control factors, require reassessment when they occur. This includes changes in \\ndecision making rights, changes in contractual arrangements, changes in the financing, ownership or capital structure as well as \\nchanges following a trigger event which was anticipated in the original documentation.  \\nAll intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between the Group companies are eliminated.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial\\n  \\nStatements\\n \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n135\\n \\nConsistent accounting policies are applied throughout the Group for the purposes of consolidation. Issuance of a subsidiary’s  \\nstock to third parties are treated as non-controlling interests. Profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests are reported \\nseparately in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. \\nAt the date that control of a subsidiary is lost, the Group a) derecognizes the assets (including attributable goodwill) and liabilities \\nof the subsidiary at their carrying amounts, b) derecognizes the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the former \\nsubsidiary, c) recognizes the fair value of the consideration received and any distribution of the shares of the subsidiary, d) \\nrecognizes any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value and e) recognizes any resulting difference of t he \\nabove items as a gain or loss in the income statement. Any amounts recognized in prior periods in other comprehensive income \\nin relation to that subsidiary would be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income or transferred directly to retained \\nearnings if required by other IFRSs. \\nAssociates \\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not a controlling interest, over the operating and \\nfinancial management policy decisions of the entity. Significant influence is generally presumed when the Group holds between \\n20% and 50% of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible \\nare considered in assessing whether the Group has significant influence. Among the other factors that are considered in \\ndetermining whether the Group has significant influence are representation on the board of directors (Supervisory Board in the \\ncase of German stock corporations) and material intercompany transactions. The existence of these factors could require the \\napplication of the equity method of accounting for a particular investment even th ough the Group’s investment is less than 20% of \\nthe voting stock. \\nInvestments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Group’s share of the results of \\nassociates is adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of the Gro up. The Group’s share in the associate’s profits and losses \\nresulting from intercompany sales is eliminated on consolidation. \\nIf the Group previously held an equity interest in an entity (for example, as available for sale) and subsequently gained significant \\ninfluence, the previously held equity interest is re-measured to fair value and any gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Income. Any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income associated with the equity interest \\nwould be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income at the date the Group gains significant influence, as if the Gr oup \\nhad disposed of the previously held equity interest. \\nUnder the equity method of accounting, the Group’s investments in associa tes and jointly controlled entities are initially recorded \\nat cost including any directly related transaction costs incurred in acquiring the associate, and subsequently increased (or \\ndecreased) to reflect both the Group’s pro -rata share of the post-acquisition net income (or loss) of the associate or jointly \\ncontrolled entity and other movements included directly in the equity of the associate or jointly controlled entity. Goodwill arising \\non the acquisition of an associate or a jointly controlled entity is included in the carrying value of the investment (net of any \\naccumulated impairment loss). As goodwill is not reported separately it is not specifically tested for impairment. Rather, the entire \\nequity method investment is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. \\nIf there is objective evidence of impairment, an impair ment test is performed by comparing the investment’s recoverable amount, \\nwhich is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, with its carrying amount. An impairment loss recognized in \\nprior periods is only reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the investment’s recoverable amo unt \\nsince the last impairment loss was recognized. If this is the case the carrying amount of the investment is increased to its higher \\nrecoverable amount. \\nAt the date that the Group ceases to have significant influence over the associate or jointly controlled entity the Group recognizes \\na gain or loss on the disposal of the equity method investment equal to the difference between the sum of the fair value of any \\nretained investment and the proceeds from disposing of the associate and the carrying amount of the investment. Amounts \\nrecognized in prior periods in other comprehensive income in relation to the associate are accounted for on the same basis as \\nwould have been required if the investee had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. \\nCritical Accounting Estimates - As the assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment may require significant \\nmanagement judgment and the estimates for impairment could change from period to period based on future events that may or \\nmay not occur, the Group considers this to be a critical accounting estimate.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n136\\n \\nForeign Currency Translation \\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro, which is the presentation currency of the Group. Various entities \\nwithin the Group use a different functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity \\noperates. \\nAn entity records foreign currency income, expenses, gains and losses in its functional currency using the rates prevailing at the \\ndates of recognition. \\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency  are translated at the period \\nend closing rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items are recogniz ed \\nin the consolidated statement of income as net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in \\norder to align the translation amounts with those recognized from foreign currency related transactions (derivatives) which \\neconomically hedge these monetary assets and liabilities. \\nNonmonetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using the historical exchange rate at the date of the \\ntransaction. Translation differences on nonmonetary items which are held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in the \\nprofit or loss. Translation differences on available for sale nonmonetary items (equity securities) are included in other \\ncomprehensive income and recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the nonmonetary item is sold as part of the \\noverall gain or loss on sale of the item. \\nFor purposes of translation into presentation currency, assets, liabilities and equity of foreign operations are translated at th e \\nperiod end closing rate and items of income and expense are translated into euros at the rates prevailing on the dates of the \\ntransactions, or average rates of exchange where these approximate actual rates. The exchange differences arising on the \\ntranslation of a foreign operation are included in other comprehensive income. For foreign operations that are subsidiaries, the \\namount of exchange differences attributable to any non-controlling interests is recognized in non-controlling interests. \\nCurrency Translation Adjustments (CTA) reflected in equity are the result of legal entities held by parent companies with a \\ndifferent functional currency.  \\nComposition of the Group \\nThere are no material changes in the composition and the expected future revenue streams of the Group compared to the period \\nending December 31, 2019.  \\nFor the composition of structured entities please refer to note  26 ‘Information on Subsidiaries and Shareholdings’.  \\nNet Commissions and Fees from Asset Management \\nAt the Group, IFRS 15 applies in particular to the fees and charges reported under ‘Net commissions and fees from asset \\nmanagement’ in the Group’s consolidated  statement of income. The income arises in connection with services that are directly \\nrelated to the Group’s ordinary business activities (asset management business) and hence fall within the scope of IFRS 15.  \\nThe Group applies the IFRS 15 five-step business model to determine revenue recognition. After a contract with a customer has \\nbeen identified in the first step, the performance obligation  – or a series of distinct performance obligations – to the customer is \\nidentified in the second step. The Group must examine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct \\nwithin the context of the contract. A promised service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or \\ntogether with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is \\nseparately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually \\nagreed transaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. Income is not recognized in profit and loss until \\nthe identified performance obligation has been satisfied. \\nManagement Fees and Performance Fees \\nThe Group is a global asset manager offering traditional active and passive strategies as well as alternative and bespoke \\nsolutions for its customers. The Group earns management fees and performance fees with different products carrying different \\nfee rates arising from trust and other fiduciary activities that result in segregated holding or investing of assets on behalf of \\nindividuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans, and others.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n137\\n \\nManagement fees are charged as a percentage of AuM and are received on a monthly or quarterly basis. Other recurring fees \\ninclude ongoing fees for products not captured in an asset class mix such as, for example, custody fees for client accounts. \\nPerformance fees are received primarily for fund management services based on the fund’s performance relative to a benchmark \\n/ target return or the realized appreciation of the fund’s investments. Variable performance fees based on specific contractual \\nterms and fees from transaction related contracts are further components of the performance and transaction fees. \\nThe terms and conditions of management fees and performance fees are governed in the asset management agreement. Asset \\nmanagement services that give rise to the management fee and performance fees constitute a single performance obligation \\nunder IFRS 15 and are considered together for revenue recognition purposes. The management and performance fee are \\nvariable consideration such that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which the entity will be entitled in \\nexchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. This includes consideration of the following constraints in the \\nestimation on the fee amount: \\n−The AuM in the case of the management fee; and\\n−The fund’s performance relative to a benchmark / target return or the realized appreciation of the fund’s investm ents in the\\ncase of the performance fee\\nManagement fees and performance fees are recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative \\namount of the transaction price would not occur. The Group updates its estimate of the transaction price for the management and \\nperformance fee at each reporting date. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received \\nand consumed by the customer over time. The Group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete \\nsatisfaction subject to the removal of any uncertainty whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative \\namount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the management fee component including other recurring fees this is the \\nend of the monthly or quarterly service period. For the performance fee and fees from securities lending transactions this is when \\nbased on the contractual provisions any uncertainty from the performance-related nature of the fee component has been fully \\nremoved. \\nThe asset management fee is often structured as so-called “all -in fee” such that it includes compensation for example for fund \\nrelated services such as administrative services and fund audit services. The Group remains the primary obligor to provide the \\nservices. In this case the revenue and expenses are reported gross as commission and fee income and general and \\nadministrative expenses respectively. \\nFor expenses incurred in relation to businesses where revenue is driven on a commission basis, and for which income is reported \\nas that commission income in the consolidated financial statements, such expenses are presented on a net basis. For example, \\nnet management fees consist of gross management fees and other-related fees, including administrative service fees, net of \\ndistribution fees paid. The total level of management fees depends on the client and product mix. Subsequently all expenses that \\nare incurred on a transaction basis and are directly incurred and incremental to the generation of fee income are presented in net \\ncommissions and fees from asset management in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.   \\nDistribution Fees \\nRevenue and expenses from the distribution of fund units arise from “front -end load” fees and “distribution” fees. The associated \\nrevenue and expenses are reported gross as commission and fee income and commission and fee expense respectively. \\nHowever, in certain distribution agreements the Group does not own the contractual obligation to perform the first time distribution \\nservice to the end-investor. Instead, a third party agent enters directly into a contractual agreement with the end-investor to \\nperform the distribution service. In this case, the Group does not report any revenue and associated expense in commission and \\nfee income and commission and fee expense respectively. \\nThe gross management fee and performance fee income and expense are disclosed in note  6 ‘Net Commissions and Fees from \\nAsset Management’ to the Group’s consolidated financia l statements. This includes income and associated expense where the \\nGroup contractually owns the performance obligation (principal) in relation to the service that gives rise to the revenue and \\nassociated expense. In contrast, it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually own the performance \\nobligation (agent). \\nCritical Accounting Estimates - The performance fee is material with a broad range of possible outcomes and although the \\nGroup has entered into similar contracts, that experience is of little predictive value in determining the future performance of the \\nproduct. As this may require significant management judgment the Group considers this to be a critical accounting estimate.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n138\\n \\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities, Financial Instrumen ts \\nIAS 32 “Financial Instruments: presentation” defines financial instruments as any contract that gives rise to a ﬁnancial asse t of \\none entity and a ﬁnancial liability or equity instrument of another entity, i.e. any contract representing contractual righ ts or \\nobligations to pay or receive cash or other ﬁnancial assets.  \\nDerivative instruments are ﬁnancial assets or liabilities that derive their value from an underlying, which require little or  no initial \\ninvestment and which are settled at a future date. The Group does not apply hedge accounting. \\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 as adopted \\nby the European Union. \\nIFRS 9 Classification and Measurement \\nIFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” sets out requirements for recognizing and measuring financial instruments. A financial instrument \\nis any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity and financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.  \\nIFRS 9 requires the classification of financial assets to be determined based on both the business model used for managing the \\nfinancial assets and contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The classification and measurement of financial \\nliabilities will continue to follow IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement”.  \\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognized in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position when th e Group \\nbecomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to \\nthe cash flows from the financial asset expire or when the contractual rights to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities \\nare derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. \\nFinancial Assets \\nNon-derivative financial assets (debt or equity instruments) are classified in accounting categories in the financial statements that \\ndetermine their accounting treatment and their subsequent measurement method. These ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed in one of \\nthe following three categories: \\n−Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n−Financial assets at amortized cost\\n−Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\nBusiness Model  \\nThere are three business models defined under IFRS  9 for financial assets: \\n−hold to collect –financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows.\\n−hold to collect and sell – financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial\\nassets\\n−other – financial assets held with trading intent or that do not meet criteria of either “hold to collect” or “hold to collect and se ll”\\nFor “hold to collect” instruments the primary objective is to collect the nominal value of the receivable and any interest payable on \\nthese instruments, they are measured at amortized cost.  \\nThe Group applies the business model “hold to collect and sell” for instruments where the  primary objective is to both collect \\ncontractual cash flows and sell financial assets, the assigned debt instruments are measured at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income. Interest income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment losses or reversals are recognised in the \\nconsolidated statement of income. The remaining fair value changes are recognised in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nderecognition, the cumulative fair value change recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled to profit or loss. \\nThe remaining Group’s assets under IFRS  9 mainly comprises of consolidated funds under IFRS 10, co-investments and seed \\ninvestment as well instruments to further diversify our liquidity and funding capabilities and these assets are considered as  “other \\nbusiness model” measured at fair value through profit and loss.  \\nSolely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) \\nIf a financial asset is held in either “hold to collect” or a “hold to collect and sell” business model, then an assessment t o \\ndetermine whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principle amount outstanding at \\ninitial recognition is required to determine the classification. \\nContractual cash flows, that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding, are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. \\nInterest is considered for the time value of the money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated F\\n inancial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n139\\n \\na particular period of time. It can also include consideration for the other basic lending risks (e.g. liquidity risk) and costs (e.g. \\nadministrative costs) associated with holding the financial assets for a particular period of time; and a profit margin that is \\nconsistent with a basic lending arrangement. \\nFinancial Liabilities \\nExcept for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the \\neffective interest method. \\nFinancial liabilities include long-term and short-term debt issued which are initially measured at fair value, which is the \\nconsideration received, net of transaction costs incurred.  \\nCertain financial liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. To be designated at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss, such financial liabilities and its designation at fair value option must eliminate or significantly reduce a \\nmeasurement or recognition inconsistency. \\nThe distinction between debt instruments and equity instruments is based on an analysis of the economic substance or \\ncontractual arrangements.  \\nA ﬁnancial liability is a debt instrument if it includes a contractual obligation:  \\n−to return cash, other financial assets or a variable number of equity instruments to an entity; or\\n−to exchange ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities with another entity under potentially unfavourable conditions.\\nAn equity instrument is a non-repayable ﬁnancial instrument that provides a discretionary return which highlights a residual \\ninterest in a company after deduction of all ﬁnancial liabilities and which is not qualiﬁed as debt instrument.  \\nImpairment  \\nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 apply to all financial assets and off balance sheet commitments. \\nThe determination of impairment losses and allowance are based on an expected credit loss model, where provisions are taken \\nupon initial recognition of the financial asset, based on expectations of potential credit losses at the time of initial recognition .  \\nIFRS 9 introduces a three stage approach to impairment for financial assets that are performing at the date of origination or \\npurchase. IFRS 9 impairment requirements applies to all financial assets measured at amortized cost and measured at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income (FVOCI) not classified and measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). The \\nexpected credit loss model (ECL) is applicable to DWS Group. The approach is summarized as follows: \\n−Stage 1: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to twelve-month expected credit losses. This\\nrepresents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within twelve months of the\\nreporting date, assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition.\\n\\n−Stage 2: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (LTECL) for those\\nFinancial Assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The\\nassessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on measuring changes in counterparty probability of default (PD) or if\\ncontractual payments are 30 days past due. This requires the computation of expected credit losses (ECL) based on lifetime\\nprobability of default (LTPD) that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the Financi al\\nAsset. Allowance for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk and the impact of a longer time\\nhorizon being considered compared to twelve months in stage 1.\\n\\n−Stage 3: The Group recognizes a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, reflecting a probabilit y\\nof default (PD) of 100%, via the recoverable cash flows for the asset, for those financial assets that are credit-impaired. The\\nGroup’s definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition.\\nDetermination of Fair Value \\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arm’s length transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets is \\ndetermined using the quoted prices where they represent those at which regularly and recently occurring transactions take place.  \\nCritical Accounting Estimates – The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices \\nquoted in active markets are not available. Therefore, where possible, parameter inputs to the valuation techniques are based on \\nobservable data derived from prices of relevant instruments traded in an active market. These valuation techniques involve some  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimat\\n es\\n \\n\\n140\\n \\nlevel of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which will depend on the price transparency for the instrument or \\nmarket and the instrument’s complexity.   \\nIn reaching estimates of fair value management judgment needs to be exercised. The areas requiring significant management \\njudgment are identified, documented and reported to senior management as part of the valuation control process and the \\nstandard monthly reporting cycle. The specialist model validation and valuation control groups focus attention on the areas o f \\nsubjectivity and judgment.  \\nThe level of management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments for which there is a quoted price in \\nan active market is usually minimal. Similarly, there is little subjectivity or judgment required for instruments valued using \\nvaluation models which are standard across the industry and where all parameter inputs are quoted in active markets. \\nWhere no market data is available for a particular instrument then pricing inputs are determined by assessing other relevant \\nsources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of the economics of the transaction and proxy information \\nfrom similar transactions, and making appropriate adjustments to reflect the actual instrument being valued and current marke t \\nconditions. Where different valuation techniques indicate a range of possible fair values for an instrument then management has \\nto decide what point within the range of estimates appropriately represents the fair value. Further, some valuation adjustments \\nmay require the exercise of management judgment to achieve fair value.  \\nUnder IFRS, the financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be disclosed according to the inputs to the \\nvaluation method that are used to determine their fair value. Specifically, segmentation is required between those valued using \\nquoted market prices in an active market (level 1), valuation techniques based on observable parameters (level 2) and valuation \\ntechniques using significant unobservable parameters (level 3). Management judgment is required in determining the category to \\nwhich certain instruments should be allocated. This specifically arises when the valuation is determined by a number of \\nparameters, some of which are observable and others are not. Further, the classification of an instrument can change over time \\nto reflect changes in market liquidity and therefore price transparency. \\nThe Group provides a sensitivity analysis of the impact upon the level 3 financial instruments of using a reasonably possib le \\nalternative for the unobservable parameter. The determination of reasonably possible alternatives requires significant \\nmanagement judgment. \\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and represents the excess of the aggregate of the cost of an \\nacquisition and any non-controlling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at the date \\nof the acquisition. \\nFor the purpose of calculating goodwill, fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by \\nreference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. This discounting is either performe d \\nusing market rates or by using risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows. Any non-controlling interest in the \\nacquiree is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net \\nassets (this is determined for each business combination). \\nGoodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalized and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are \\nindications that impairment may have occurred.  \\nIf goodwill has been capitalized and an operation is disposed of, the attributable goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the \\noperation when determining the gain or loss on its disposal. \\nIntangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights \\nand their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are stated at cost less any \\naccumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Customer-related intangible assets that have a finite useful life \\nare amortized over periods of between 1 and 20 years on a straight-line basis based on their expected useful life. These assets \\nare tested for impairment and their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually. \\nCertain intangible assets have an indefinite useful life and hence are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least \\nannually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. \\nCosts related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits will \\nflow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the \\nasset’s useful life which is deemed to be either three, five or  ten years. Eligible costs include external direct costs for materials  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n141\\n \\nand services, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with an internal-use software project. \\nOverhead costs, as well as costs incurred during the research phase or after software is ready for use, are expensed as incurred. \\nCapitalized software costs are tested for impairment either annually if still under development or when there is an indication of \\nimpairment once the software is in use. \\nCritical Accounting Estimates – The determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial \\nassets requires estimates based on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation \\ntechniques, or a combination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. Since these \\nestimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to \\nchange, the Group considers these estimates to be critical.  \\nProvisions \\nProvisions are recognized if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, if it is probable \\nthat an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the \\nobligation. \\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation as of the \\nbalance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. \\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted and measured at the present value of the \\nexpenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation, using a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is \\nrecognized as interest expense.  \\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party (for \\nexample, because the obligation is covered by an insurance policy), an asset is recognized if it is virtually certain that \\nreimbursement will be received. \\nCritical Accounting Estimates – The use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise \\nfrom litigation and regulatory proceedings. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of litigation \\nand regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance with IAS 37 \\n“Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and th e \\nGroup’s final liabilities may ultimately be mater ially different. \\nContingencies in respect of legal matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not \\npredictable with assurance. Significant judgment is required in assessing probability and making estimates in respect of \\ncontingencies, and the Group’s final liability may ultimately be materially different. The Group’s total liability in respect  of litigation, \\narbitration and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by -case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after \\nconsidering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Group’s experience and the experience of others in similar \\ncases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Predicting the outcome of the Group’s litigation matters is inh erently difficult, \\nparticularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages.  \\nIncome Taxes \\nThe Group recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements using the provisions of the respective jurisdictions’ tax laws. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in \\nprofit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items that are recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income \\nin which case the related tax is recognized directly in either equity or other comprehensive income accordingly. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the \\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and \\nunused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be \\navailable against which those unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the asset is \\nrealized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance \\nsheet date.  \\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when (1) they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities, \\n(2) the legally enforceable right to offset exists and (3) they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously. DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n142\\n \\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities exists and \\nthe deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the same tax reporting \\nentity or tax group of reporting entities. \\nDeferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and \\nassociates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the \\nGroup and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are provided on \\ndeductible temporary differences arising from such investments only to the extent that it is probable that the differences wi ll \\nreverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be available against which those temporary differences can be \\nutilized. \\nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of financial instruments, which are charged or credited directly to other \\ncomprehensive income, is also credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the \\nstatement of income once the underlying transaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the statement of \\nincome. \\nNon-Controlling Interests \\nNon-controlling interests are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity, which is distinct from \\nthe Group’s shareholders’ equity. The net income attributable to non -controlling interests is separately disclosed on the face of \\nthe consolidated statement of income. Changes in the ownership interest in subsidiaries which do not result in a change of control \\nare treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in additional paid-in capital (APIC) within equity.  \\nLeases \\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to \\ncontrol the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. These contracts will mainly relate to office \\nbuildings and other leases for vehicles. \\nThe Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-\\nvalue assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of -use assets representing the right to use \\nthe underlying assets. \\nRight-of-use assets \\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available \\nfor use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for \\nany remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right- of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial \\ndirect costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-\\nof-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the \\nassets. The right-of-use assets are also subject to an annual impairment review. \\nLease liabilities  \\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments \\nto be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease \\npayments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease \\npayments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of \\npenalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. \\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period in which the event or \\ncondition that triggers the payment occurs. \\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement \\ndate if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease \\nliabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying \\namount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments \\n(e.g. changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a \\nchange in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consol\\n idated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates\\n  \\n\\n143\\n \\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets \\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption for short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of \\n12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases \\nand leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \\nCritical Accounting Estimates – The determination of the right-of-use assets requires estimates on the interest rate implicit in \\nthe lease, and if this rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate, \\nnecessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. Since these estimates and assumptions could result \\nin significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change, the Group considers these \\nestimates to be critical.  \\nEmployee Benefits \\nShare-Based Compensation Plans \\nIn DWS Group there are two main categories of share-based compensation plans, which are described below: \\nDWS Share-Based Plans (cash-settled) \\nThe Group made grants of share-based compensation under the DWS Equity Plan. This plan represents a contingent right to \\nreceive a cash payment by referencing to the value of DWS shares during a specified time period.  \\nIn September 2018, IPO related Awards were granted to selected employees within the Group. Both Awards (DWS Equity Plan \\nand DWS Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan) are considered as share-based cash-settled awards.  \\nAll employees who are offered DWS Equity Plan Awards are subject to performance condition and forfeiture provision which need \\nto be met for each tranche to be capable of settlement. In case such performance conditions are not met, the tranche will lapse. \\nEmployees who are offered DWS SAR Plan Awards are also subject to specific performance and forfeiture provisions, as \\napplicable under the SAR Plan. \\nCompensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the \\nawards relate, or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. Estimates of expected forfeitures are \\nperiodically adjusted in the event of actual forfeitures or for changes in expectations. The timing of expense recognition relating to \\ngrants which, due to early retirement provisions, include a nominal but non-substantive service period are accelerated by \\nshortening the amortization period of the expense from the grant date to the date when the employee meets the eligibility criteria \\nfor the award, and not the vesting date. For awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award \\nand amortized separately. \\nThe principal inputs for the fair value of the awards are the market value on reporting date, discounted for any dividends foregone \\nover the holding periods of the award, and adjustment for expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the \\nnumber of eligible employees leaving the Group and number of employees eligible for early retirement.  \\nThe liabilities incurred are re-measured at the end of each reporting period until settlement with recognizing any gains and losses \\nin profit and loss. \\nDB Equity Plan (equity-settled) \\nThe Group employees continue to participate in the DB Equity Plan under the rules established for Deutsche Bank Group as \\napplicable.  \\nShare-based payment transactions where Deutsche Bank AG as parent company grants Deutsche Bank AG shares to the \\nemployees of the Group are classified as equity-settled transactions reflected in the equity in the consolidated financial \\nstatements of the Group as Deutsche Bank AG has the obligation to settle the shares. \\nThe substance of the Deutsche Bank’s shar e award programs is that Deutsche Bank AG makes a capital contribution to the \\nGroup, which correspondingly makes a share-based payment to its employees in exchange for services. Compensation cost \\nrelated to the grant of parent company awards to employees of the Group are recognized in the consolidated financial statements \\nas compensation expense with a corresponding credit to equity. The compensation expense based on the fair value at grant date \\nof the awards (and adjusted for expected forfeitures) is amortized over the requisite substantial service period of the award. \\nFor share awards, the fair value is the quoted market price of the share reduced by the present value of the expected dividends \\nfrom Deutsche Bank AG that will not be received by the employee and adjusted for the effect, if any, of restrictions beyond the  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nSignificant Accounting Policies and\\n  \\nEstimates\\n \\n\\n144\\n \\nvesting date. In case an award is modified such that its fair value immediately after modification exceeds its fair value immediately \\nprior to modification, a re-measurement takes place and the resulting increase in fair value is recognized as additional \\ncompensation expense in the consolidated financials of the Group.  \\nCompensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the \\nawards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. Estimates of expected forfeitures are \\nperiodically adjusted in the event of actual forfeitures or for changes in expectations. The timing of expense recognition relating to \\ngrants which, due to early retirement provisions, include a nominal but non-substantive service period are accelerated by \\nshortening the amortization period of the expense from the grant date to the date when the employee meets the eligibility criteria \\nfor the award, and not the vesting date. For awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award \\nand amortized separately. \\nIf there are recharge arrangements in place to compensate Deutsche Bank AG for the cost of acquiring the shares to settle its \\nobligation, the Group recognizes a corresponding liability that is accrued over the respective service/vesting period. \\nFrom the perspective of the Group, the recharge forms part of the determination of the net capital contribution received in respect \\nof the share-based payment transaction. As the Group recognizes a capital contribution as part of the accounting for the share-\\nbased payment transaction, the Group recognizes its reimbursement of the contribution to DB Group Services Ltd. (as \\nadministrator of the DB Group wide award process) as an adjustment of that capital contribution. The Group therefore recognizes \\na recharge liability with a corresponding debit in equity. \\nThe liabilities incurred are re-measured at the end of each reporting period until settlement, recognizing any gains and losses in \\nequity.  \\nPension Benefits \\nThe Group provides a number of pension plans. In addition to defined contribution plans, there are retirement benefit plans \\naccounted for as defined benefit plans. The assets of all the Group’s defined contribution plans are held in independently \\nadministered funds. Contributions are generally determined as a percentage of salary and are expensed based on employee \\nservices rendered, generally in the year of contribution. \\nAll retirement benefit plans accounted for as defined benefit plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method to determine \\nthe present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, the determination is based on \\nactuarial calculations which include assumptions about demographics, salary increases and interest and inflation rates. Actuarial \\ngains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in equity in the period in which they occur. The \\nmajority of the Group’s benefit plans is funded.  \\nOther Post-Employment Benefits \\nIn addition, the Group maintains unfunded contributory post-employment medical plans for a number of current and retired \\nemployees who are mainly located in the United States. These plans pay stated percentages of eligible medical and dental \\nexpenses of retirees after a stated deductible has been met. DB Group funds these plans on a cash basis as benefits are due \\nand re-charges these amounts to the Group. Analogous to retirement benefit plans these plans are valued using the projected \\nunit-credit method. The Group only pays for participation in these plans. \\nRefer to note 23 ‘Employee Benefits’ for further information on the accounting for pension benefits and other  post-employment \\nbenefits. \\nTermination Benefits \\nTermination benefits arise when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date or whenever an \\nemployee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognizes termination benefits as a liability \\nand an expense if the Group is demonstrably committed to a detailed formal plan without realistic possibility of withdrawal. In the \\ncase of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees \\nexpected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due in more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period are discounted \\nto their present value. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. \\nChanges on estimates and their underlying assumptions \\nIn particular, the following changes were made for the reporting period based on past experience:  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nRecently Adopted and New Accounting \\n\\nPronouncements\\n  \\n\\n145\\n \\nChange in estimate of the service period for certain compensation awards  \\nAs a result of recent developments and historical experience, during the second quarter of 2020 the Group has changed its \\nestimate of the service period for certain compensation awards granted to employees to recognize compensation expense over \\nthe respective vesting periods in which the related employee services are rendered. As a result of the change in estimate, the \\nGroup’s net award liability reduced by € 21 million.  \\nChange in estimate of key financial assumptions applied to the Group’s pension obligat ions  \\nThe discount rate and inflation rate assumptions in the Eurozone are key drivers to the Group’s pension obligations. In 2020  a \\nreview was conducted on the methodology to set these assumptions and various refinements were implemented during the year. \\nThe combined effect of these refinements, reflected in other comprehensive income, reduced the Group’s overall pension \\nobligations in the Eurozone at December 31, 2020 by € 21 million relative to the approach adopted at December 31, 2019.   \\nStatement of Cash Flows \\nThe Group’s assignment of cash flows to the operating, investing or financing category depends on the business model \\n(“management approach”). For the Group the primary operating activity is to serve a range of traditional and alternative \\ninvestment capabilities to institutional and retail clients worldwide with the aim to become a leading ESG asset manager. \\nThe amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated \\nbalance sheet from one period to the next as they exclude non-cash items such as movements due to foreign exchange \\ntranslation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies. \\nThe movements in balances carried at fair value through profit or loss shown in operating cash flows represent all changes \\nimpacting the carrying value. This includes the impact of market movements and cash inflows and outflows. \\nNon-Participating Investment Contracts \\nThese contracts do not contain significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features and therefore are not considered \\nunder IFRS 4 “Insurance contracts”. These are measured and reported consistently with other financial liabilities, which are \\nclassified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. \\nAll of the Group’s investment contracts are unit -linked. These contract liabilities are determined using current unit prices multiplied \\nby the number of units attributed to the contract holders as of the balance sheet date. \\nFinancial assets arising from these investment contracts, as well as financial liabilities arising from these investment contracts, \\nare measured at fair value with changes in value recognised in profit or loss.  \\n\\n03 – Recently Adopted and New Accounting Pronouncements \\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies applied in these consolidated financial statements are the same as those \\napplied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2019.   \\nThe Group has adopted the amendment to IFRS 3 “Business combinations” and the Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of \\nFinancial Statements” and IAS 8 “Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”” effective January 1, 2020.  \\nEffective June 1, 2020 the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 16 “Leases”.    \\nIFRS 3 “Business combinations”  \\nOn January 1, 2020, the Group adopted amendments to IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. These amendments clarify the \\ndetermination of whether an acquisition made is of a business or a group of assets. The amended definition of a business \\nemphasizes that the output of a business is to provide goods and services to customers, whereas the previous definition focus ed \\non returns in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits to investors and others. Distinguishing between a \\nbusiness and a group of assets is important because an acquirer recognizes goodwill only when acquiring a business. The \\nadoption of the amendments did not have an impact on the Group’s consoli dated financial statements.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nRecently Adopted and New Accounting \\n\\nPronouncements\\n  \\n\\n146\\n \\nAmendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” and IAS 8 “Accounting policies, \\nchanges in accounting estimates and errors”  \\nOn January 1, 2020, the Group adopted amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” and IAS 8 “Accounting \\npolicies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”. The amendments align the definition of ‘material’ across the standards  and \\nclarify certain aspects of the definition. The new definition states that “information is material if  omitting, misstating or obscuring it \\ncould reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on th e \\nbasis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific r eporting entity.” The amendments clarify \\nthat materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information. An entity will need to assess whether the information, either \\nindividually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of the financial statements. A misstatement of \\ninformation is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users. The adoption of the \\namendments did not have an impact on the Group’s consolidated financial stateme nts. \\nIFRS 16 “Leases” \\nOn June 1, 2020, the Group adopted amendments to IFRS 16 “Leases” that include COVID -19-Related Rent Concessions to \\nprovide lessees with an exemption from assessing whether a COVID-19 -related rent concession is a lease modification. T he \\nadoption of the amendments did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  \\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \\nThe following accounting pronouncements were not effective as of December 31, 2020 and therefore have not been applied in \\n2020. \\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, IAS 39 \\n“Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”, IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: \\nDisclosures” and IFRS 16 “Leases”)  \\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, IAS 39, “Financial Instruments: Recognition \\nand Measurement“, IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and IFRS 16, “Leases” as Phase 2 of their project addressing \\nthe potential effects from the reform of the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) on financial reporting. The amendments in Phase 2 \\ndeal with replacement issues, therefore, they address issues that might affect financial reporting when an existing interest rate \\nbenchmark is actually replaced. This includes modification of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities as well as \\nspecific hedge accounting requirements. The amendments introduce a practical expedient for modifications required by the \\nreform (modifications required as a direct consequence of the IBOR reform and made on an economically equivalent basis). \\nThese modifications are accounted for by updating the effective interest rate. All other modifications are accounted for using the \\ncurrent IFRS requirements. A similar practical expedient is introduced for lessee accounting applying IFRS 16.  \\nThe amendments also require additional disclosures that allow users to understand the nature and extent of risks arising from the \\nIBOR reform to which the entity is exposed to and how the enti ty manages those risks as well as the entity’s progress in \\ntransitioning from IBORs to alternative benchmark rates, and how the entity is managing this transition. The amendments will  be \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a \\nmaterial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.   \\n IFRS 3 “Business combinations”  \\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 “Business combinations”. The amendments update  an outdated reference \\nin IFRS 3 without significantly changing its requirements. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after \\nJanuary 1, 2022 with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the Grou p’s consolidated \\nfinancial statements. These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. \\nIAS 37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”  \\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37, “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets” to clarify what \\ncosts an entity considers in assessing whether a contract is onerous. The amendments specify that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a \\ncontract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’. Costs that relate directly to a  contract can either be incremental \\ncosts of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to \\nfulfilling contracts (an example would be the allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment \\nused in fulfilling the contract). The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with early  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes t\\no the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\n\\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\\n  \\n\\n147\\n \\nadoption permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the Group’s  consolidated financial statements. These \\namendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. \\nIAS 16 “Property, plant and equipment”  \\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 16 “Property, plant and equipment”. The amendments prohibit deducting from \\nthe cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the \\nlocation and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity \\nrecognizes the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, in profit or loss. The amendments are \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a \\nmaterial impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.  \\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non- current (amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of \\nFinancial Statements”)  \\nIn January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as \\nCurrent or Non-Current”. They clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non -current should be based on rights that \\nare in existence at the end of the reporting period. The amendments also clarify that classification is unaffected by expectations \\nabout whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability and make clear that settlement refers to the transfer \\nto the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services. The amendments will be effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the \\nGroup’s consolidated financial statements. These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. \\nImprovements to IFRS 2018-2020 Cycles  \\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to multiple IFRS standards, which resulted from the IASB’s annual improvement \\nproject for the 2018-2020 cycles. This comprises amendments that result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or \\nmeasurement purposes as well as terminology or editorial amendments related to IFRS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements  - \\nFirst-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards”, IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, IFRS 16 “Leases” and IAS 41 \\n“Agriculture”. The amendments to IFRS 9 clarify which fees an entity includes when it applies the 10 per cent test in paragra ph \\nB3.3.6 of IFRS 9 in assessing whether to derecognize a financial liability. An entity includes only fees paid or received between \\nthe entity (the borrower) and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other’s b ehalf. The \\namendments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 with early adoption permitted. The \\namendments will not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. These amendments have not  yet \\nbeen endorsed by the EU. \\n\\n04 – Acquisitions and Dispositions \\nBusiness Combinations \\nIn the period January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 there were no acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. \\nAcquisitions \\nIn the period January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, DWS Group did not engage in any material acquisition. \\nDispositions \\nIn the period January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 DWS Group did not dispose any affiliates or business.

Although an entity cannot have more tha n \\none CODM, the CODM can be a group of persons. Generally, an operating segment has a segment manager who is directly \\naccountable to and maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, or plans \\nfor the segment. The term ‘segment manager’ also identifies a functio n, not necessary a single manager with a specific title. \\nThe Group - based on this management approach - operates a single business segment for reporting and controlling purposes. \\nThe Executive Board will be responsible as CODM for reviewing and monitoring the results of the Group and making strategic \\ndecisions around asset allocation and resources. The segment manager is the Executive Board. \\nThe Group’s operating activity is managed using one globally integrated investment group targeting the same client s egments, \\ndistribution channels and asset classes. There is one centrally managed sales force servicing all of the business units/products \\nand negotiating prices with clients and the Group is using largely shared infrastructure and support services (such as marketing, \\nproduct strategy, product development and finance). \\nThe Executive Board extends to the steering and oversight of the entire Group such as strategy, planning, major personnel \\ndecisions, organisation, risk management and compliance systems. \\nSubsequently, the Executive Board sets strategy for the Group and its individual parts including the one centrally managed sales \\nforce and the largely shared infrastructure and support services. Although revenues will be monitored by the different asset \\nclasses - i.e. Traditional (Active/Passive) and Alternatives, all other direct and allocated costs, along with assets and liabilities, but \\nalso full-time employee and capital ratios will be analysed and monitored on an aggregated basis.  \\nThe following table presents total net interest and non-interest income by geographic area - based on the management approach \\nof the Group: \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n 2020\\n \\n2019\\n \\n\\nGermany\\n \\n 989\\n \\n1,045\\n \\n\\nEurope (excluding Germany), Middle East and Africa\\n \\n 631\\n \\n725\\n \\n\\nAmericas\\n \\n 483\\n \\n504\\n \\n\\nAsia/Pacific\\n \\n 134\\n \\n115\\n \\n\\nTotal net interest and non\\n-\\ninterest income\\n \\n 2,237\\n \\n2,389\\n  DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Income Statement\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Net Commissions and Fees\\n  \\nfrom Asset Management\\n  \\n\\n149\\n \\nNotes to the Consolidated Income Statement \\n06 – Net Commissions and Fees from Asset Management \\nManagement fees are recognised as and when the service is performed and are charged largely as a percentage of AuM and are \\ngenerally received on a monthly or quarterly basis. They mainly relate to gross fund management fees received and gross \\nexpenses mainly relate to distribution fees paid. \\nPerformance fees are recognised based on the fund’s performance relative to a benchmark/target r eturn or the realized \\nappreciation of the fund’s investments. Variable performance fees based on specific contractual terms and fees from transacti on \\nrelated contracts (such as for real estate transactions for alternative funds) are further components of the performance and \\ntransaction fees. \\nThe split of net commissions and fees from asset management by product and type is as follows: \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n 2020\\n \\n2019\\n \\n\\nManagement fees:\\n \\n\\nManagement fee income\\n \\n 3,200\\n \\n3,189\\n \\n\\nManagement fee expense\\n \\n 1,067\\n \\n1,053\\n \\n\\nNet management fees\\n \\n 2,134\\n \\n2,136\\n \\n\\nThereof:\\n \\n\\nActive Equity\\n \\n 658\\n \\n676\\n \\n\\nActive Multi Asset\\n \\n 187\\n \\n182\\n \\n\\nActive SQI\\n1\\n \\n 187\\n \\n183\\n \\n\\nActive Fixed Income\\n \\n 288\\n \\n290\\n \\n\\nActive Cash\\n \\n 30\\n \\n25\\n \\n\\nPassive\\n \\n 300\\n \\n287\\n \\n\\nAlternatives\\n \\n 464\\n \\n475\\n \\n\\nOther\\n2\\n \\n 20\\n \\n17\\n \\n\\nPerformance and transaction fees:\\n \\n\\nPerformance and transaction fee income\\n \\n 109\\n \\n213\\n \\n\\nPerformance and transaction fee expense\\n \\n 19\\n \\n8\\n \\n\\nNet performance and transaction fees\\n \\n 90\\n \\n205\\n \\n\\nThereof:\\n \\n\\nAlternatives\\n \\n 56\\n \\n94\\n \\n\\nActive and Other\\n \\n 34\\n \\n110\\n \\n\\nTotal net commissions and fees from asset management\\n \\n 2,223\\n \\n2,341\\n \\n\\n1 SQI stands for Systematic & Quantitative Investments. \\n2  Other recurring fees include ongoing fees for products not captured in a product mix, for example, custody fees for client accounts. \\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were unsatisfied performance obligations with an expected original maturity of more than one \\nyear of € 66 million with a time band of seven years from 2022 to 2028 from alternative funds. The decrease  of the unsatisfied \\nperformance obligations compared to December 31, 2019 (€ 75 million with a time band of seven years from  2021 to 2027) was \\nmainly driven by a change in the fund model.

The funds’ assets \\nbelong to investors and are consolidated under IFRS 10 even though DWS is not an investor. The Group reports the \\ncorresponding liabilities (including cash and bank balances) as financial liabilities held at fair value in the position ‘Pay ables from \\nguaranteed and other consolidated funds’ under financial instruments carried at fair value (see note 12 ‘Financial Instruments \\ncarried at Fair Value’). The consolidated guaranteed mutual funds decreased by € 211 million, mainly driven by liquidation of  one \\nfund (€ 157 million), mark-to-market valuation losses (€ 30 million) and net disposals (€ 25 million). This was partially offset by a \\nnet increase of seed investments (€ 86 million).  \\nThe non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss include co-investments and seed investments, \\ncorporate cash invested into money market funds, and government bonds mainly held for regulatory purposes. The non-trading \\nfinancial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss decreased by € 321 million primarily driven by a reduction of  \\ncorporate cash invested into money market funds (€ 266 million as of December 31, 2020, € 518 million as of December 31, \\n2019) and a decrease of government bonds (€ 404 million as of December 31, 2020, € 443 million as of December 31, 2019).  \\nThe investment contract assets are matched by the respective liabilities at fair value through profit or loss ( € 526 million as of \\nDecember 31, 2020, € 544 million as of December 31, 2019). The decrease is mainly driven by net redemptions and maturities of \\n€ 24 million and offset by positive performance of € 6 million within the related investment funds. This net movement for the  year \\nis reflected in both investment contract assets and liabilities. \\nThe negative market values from derivative financial instruments mainly include the change in fair value of guaranteed contracts \\nwhich do not qualify as a financial guarantee (€ 155 million as of December 31, 2020, € 108 million as of December 31, 2019).   \\nFurther details of the financial assets/liabilities carried at fair value including a breakdown into classes of financial instruments are \\nshown in note 12 ‘Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value’.

The amortised cost value as of December 31, 2020 was €  195 million. \\n\\n12 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value \\nOverview \\nThe Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value into the following categories: \\n−trading assets and trading liabilities, measured at fair value through profit or loss\\n−positive market value from derivative financial instruments, measured at fair value through profit or loss\\n−non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss,\\n−investment contract assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss,\\n−debt instruments mandatory at fair value through other comprehensive income,\\n−negative market value from derivative financial instruments, measured at fair value through profit or loss\\n−investment contract liabilities, designated at fair value through profit or loss, and\\n−payables from guaranteed and other consolidated funds, measured at amortized cost\\nAppropriate classification of financial assets and liabilities at fair value is determined at the time of initial recognition or when \\nreclassified in the balance sheet. \\nFinancial instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss are recognised or derecognised on trade date, which is the date \\non which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset or issue or repurchase the financial liability.  \\nPayables from guaranteed and other consolidated funds are shown in other liabilities in the balance sheet. The valuation basis of \\nthe other liabilities reflected at amortized cost is the fair value of the respective assets. The Group reflects these liabilities with \\ntheir implied fair value.  \\nFair Value Hierarchy \\nThe financial instruments carried at fair value have been categorised under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy as \\nfollows: \\nLevel 1 - Instruments valued using quoted prices in active markets  are instruments where the fair value can be determined \\ndirectly from prices which are quoted in active, liquid markets and where the instrument observed in the market is representative \\nof that being priced in the Group\\'s inventory. \\nThese include: government bonds and equity instruments and derivatives traded on active, liquid exchanges. \\nLevel 2 - Instruments valued with valuation techniques using observable market data  are instruments where the fair value \\ncan be determined by reference to similar instruments trading in active markets, or where a technique is used to derive the \\nvaluation but where all inputs to that technique are observable.

Instruments classified in this category have an element which is unobservable and which \\nhas a significant impact on the fair value. \\nThese mainly include co-investments. \\nThe following table shows the fair values for each class of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, including their \\nlevels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information of financial assets and financial liabilities not measured \\nat fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of its fair value. \\nThe carrying value of the investments in the table equals the fair value of these investments. \\n\\nDec 31, 2020\\n \\n\\nFair value\\n \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Quoted\\n \\n\\nprices in\\n \\n\\nactive\\n

All valuations are performed on a recurring basis. \\nPrices quoted in active markets – The fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the \\nquoted prices where they represent prices at which regularly and recently occurring transactions take place. \\nValuation techniques using observable market data – The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of \\ninstruments where prices quoted in active markets are not available. Valuation techniques used for financial instruments include \\nmodelling techniques, the use of indicative quotes for proxy instruments, quotes from recent and less regular transactions an d \\nbroker quotes.  \\nFor some financial instruments a rate or other parameter, rather than a price is quoted. Where this is the case then the market \\nrate or parameter is used as an input to a valuation model to determine fair value. For some instruments, modelling technique s \\nfollow industry standard models, for example, discounted cash flow analysis and standard option pricing models. These models \\nare dependent upon estimated future cash flows, discount factors and volatility levels.  \\nFrequently, valuation models require multiple parameter inputs. Where possible, parameter inputs are based on observable data \\nor are derived from the prices of relevant instruments traded in active markets. Where observable data is not available for \\nparameter inputs, then other market information is considered. For example, indicative broker quotes and consensus pricing \\ninformation are used to support parameter inputs where they are available.  \\nValuation techniques using unobservable market data  - Where no observable information is available to support parameter \\ninputs then they are based on other relevant sources of information such as prices for similar transactions, historic data, \\neconomic fundamentals, and research information, with appropriate adjustment to reflect the terms of the actual instrument be ing \\nvalued and current market conditions.   DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet\\n  \\n\\nFinancial Instruments carried at Fair Value\\n  \\n\\n156\\n \\nSignificant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments are subject to regular reviews. If third party information, such as broke r \\nquotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation control group assesses the evidence obtained from \\nthe third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value \\nhierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. \\nValidation and control - The Group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards, \\nmethodologies, and procedures over the valuation process. The Principal Valuation Control Council (PVCC) is a key forum for the \\nGroup to review the completeness control results and ensure that all fair value assets and liabilities have been subject to the \\nappropriate valuation control process. In addition, the PVCC ensures review and appropriateness of various detailed aspects o f \\nthe controls such as Independent Price Verification classification, testing thresholds and market data approvals.  \\nDB Group has an independent specialised valuation control group within its Risk function which governs and develops the \\nvaluation control framework and manages the valuation control processes which covers the valuation of financial instruments \\nacross all levels of the fair value hierarchy. The mandate of this specialist function includes the performance of the independent \\nvaluation control process for all businesses including DWS Group, the continued development of valuation control methodologies \\nand techniques, as well as devising and governing the formal valuation control policy framework. A key focus of this independent \\nvaluation control group is directed to areas where management judgment forms part of the valuation process, including regular \\nreview of significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments mentioned above. The PVCC oversees the valuation control \\nprocesses performed by DB Group’s specialist valuation f unction on behalf of the Group.  \\nResults of the valuation control process are collected and analysed as part of a standard monthly reporting cycle. Variances \\noutside of pre-set and approved tolerance levels are escalated both within the Finance function and Senior Business \\nManagement for review, resolution and, if required, adjustment. This process is summarised in the Valuation Control Report, a nd \\nreviewed by the PVCC. \\nFor instruments where fair value is determined from valuation models, the assumptions and techniques used within the models \\nare independently validated by DB Group’s independent specialist model validation group.   \\nValuation Techniques \\nThe following are explanations of the valuation techniques used in establishing the fair value of the different classes and types of \\nfinancial instruments that the Group trades. \\nTrading assets and Payables from guaranteed and other consolidated funds \\nGuaranteed Funds – the assets are reflected under trading assets and valuation follows the valuation prepared by the \\nconsolidated guaranteed fund and includes relevant IFRS adjustments if applicable. The liabilities are reflected under payables \\nfrom guaranteed and other consolidated funds and the valuation of the implied fair value is based on the valuation of the \\nrespective assets.  \\nDerivatives \\nThe Group manages guaranteed retirement accounts which provide a full or partial notional guarantee at maturity. This guarantee \\nis not considered as a financial guarantee but as a derivative. Depending on the account, guarantee level and on the maturity of \\nthe account, all accounts are invested in a combination of dedicated government bond funds with fixed duration and dedicated \\nequity and balanced target funds. The valuation of accounts is dependent on the valuation of the underlying target funds. The fair \\nvalue for the accounts shortfall is calculated with option pricing models using Monte-Carlo simulations including the behavioural \\nrisk of the client. \\nNon-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss \\nWhere there are no recent transactions then fair value may be determined from the last market price adjusted for all changes  in \\nrisks and information since that date. Where a close proxy instrument is quoted in an active market then fair value is determ ined \\nby adjusting the proxy value for differences in the risk profile of the instruments. Where close proxies are not available then fair \\nvalue is estimated using more complex modelling techniques. These techniques include discounted cash flow models using \\ncurrent market rates for credit, interest, liquidity and other risks. For equity instruments and investment funds modelling \\ntechniques may also include those based on earnings multiples.

The investment contract obliges the \\nGroup to use these assets to settle these liabilities. Therefore, the fair value of investment contract liabilities is determined by the \\nfair value of the underlying assets based on the published fund price.  \\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \\nThe valuation of the bond is based on observed market prices as well as broker quotes. \\nTransfers \\nTransfers between levels 1 and 2 take place when there is a change in the inputs that is relevant to categorization in the fair value \\nhierarchy.  \\nWhere applicable, transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 are assumed to take place at the beginning of the year. \\nThere were no transfers between level 1 and 2 in 2020 and in 2019 respectively. \\nLevel 3 Transfers \\nThere were transfers into level 3 in the amount of € 1 million during the year ending December 31, 2020 ( € 0 million for the year \\nending December 31, 2019).  \\nAnalysis of Financial Instruments with Fair Value Derived from Valuation Techniques \\nContaining Significant Unobservable Parameters (Level 3) \\nFinancial assets/liabilities at fair value categorised in this level of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on one or more \\nunobservable parameters.  \\nNon-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss include unlisted equity instruments where there is no \\nclose proxy and the market is illiquid.

Appropriate levels for these unobservable input parameters are selected to ensure consistency with prevailing \\nmarket evidence. Where the Group has marked the financial instruments using parameter values drawn from the extremes of the \\nrange of reasonably possible alternatives, then as of December 31, 2020 it could have increased fair value by as much as \\n€ 15 million or decreased fair value by as much as €  50 million. As of December 31, 2019 it could have increased fair value by as \\nmuch as € 2 million or decreased fair value by as much as € 35 million. \\nThe changes in sensitivities from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 show an increase to the negative fair value \\nmovement from using reasonable possible alternatives by € 15 million mainly driven by market movements including updates to \\nthe cancellation rate.  \\nThe sensitivity calculation aligns to the approach used to assess valuation uncertainty for prudent valuation purposes. Prudent \\nvaluation is a mechanism for quantifying valuation uncertainty and assessing an exit price with a 90% certainty. Under EU \\nregulation, the additional valuation adjustments (AVAs) would be applied as a deduction from Tier 1 capital (CET1).

The disposal related to the agreement \\nto sell the Group’s Hedge Fund UCITS business, by way of an asset sale, to an external buyer, pursuant to an asset purchase \\nagreement signed on June 13, 2019 which was completed on January 11, 2020 (please refer to note 18  ‘Non-Current Assets and \\nDisposal Groups Held for Sale’). \\nGoodwill Impairment Test \\nGoodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment purposes on cash-generating unit (CGU) level. The Group has one CGU \\nfor the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets as the Group is managed as a single business segment  on \\nasset management for controlling and reporting purposes. \\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU. During 2020 and \\n2019 respectively the Group did not acquire goodwill in a business combination.  \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter by comparing the recoverable amount of the goodwill with the \\ncarrying amount. In addition, in accordance with IAS  36 “Impairment of assets”, the Group tests goodwill whenever a triggering  \\nevent is identified. The recoverable amount is the higher of the Group’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in u se. \\nThe annual goodwill impairment test conducted in 2020 and 2019 respectively, did not result in an impairment loss on the Grou p’s \\ngoodwill since the recoverable amount of the CGU was higher than the respective carrying amount.   \\nA review of the Group’s strategy, political or global risks for the Asset Management industry such as a return of the European \\nsovereign debt crisis, uncertainties regarding the implementation of already adopted regulation as well as a slowdown of GDP \\ngrowth may negatively impact the performance forecasts and thus, could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. \\nCarrying Amount \\nThe carrying amount for the CGU is determined on the basis of the Group’s equity.  \\nRecoverable Amount \\nThe Group determines the recoverable amount on the basis of value in use and employs the discounted cash-flow method (DCF) \\nwhich reflects the specifics of the Asset Management business and its regulatory environment. The model calculates the presen t \\nvalue of the estimated future earnings that are distributable to the shareholders after fulfilling the respective regulatory capital \\nrequirements. \\nThe DCF uses earnings projections based on five-year strategic plans, which are discounted to their present value. Estimating \\nfuture earnings involves judgment and the consideration of past and current performance as well as expected capital retention \\nrequirements / contributions in line with the business plan, market expectations and commercial, legal or regulatory requirements. \\nEarnings projections beyond the initial five-year period are adjusted to derive a sustainable level. In case of a going concern, the \\ncash flow to equity is assumed to increase by or converge towards a constant long-term growth rate of up to 3.1% in 2020 and \\n1.3% in 2019. This is based on the revenue forecast as well as expectations for the development of gross domestic product and  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet\\n  \\n\\nGoodwill and Other Int\\n angible Assets\\n  \\n\\n164\\n \\ninflation, and is captured in the terminal value. The rate was reduced by 1.5% for 2019 and is comparably low compared to \\nanalysts’ views and reflects a conserv ative approach. \\nKey Assumptions and Sensitivities \\nKey Assumptions: The DCF value of a CGU is sensitive to the earnings projections, to the discount rate (cost of equity) applied \\nand to the long-term growth rate. The discount rates applied have been determined based on the capital asset pricing model and \\ncomprise a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium and a factor covering the systematic market risk (beta factor). The \\nvalues for the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and the beta factors are determined using external sources of \\ninformation. CGU-specific beta factors are determined based on a respective group of peer companies. Variations in all of these \\ncomponents might impact the discount rates. The Group use a discount rate (after tax) of 9.8% in 2020 (2019: 9.6%). \\nManagement determined the values for the key assumptions based on a combination of internal and external analysis. Estimates \\nfor efficiency and the cost reduction program are based on progress made to date and scheduled future projects and initiatives \\nKey Management Assumptions are: \\n−Deliver strong investment product performance\\n−Expand product suite in growth areas (e.g. alternatives, multi assets, passive, ESG investment schemes) while consolidating\\nnon-core strategies\\n−Consistent net flows leveraging market share leadership in Germany and the rest of Europe, while expanding coverage in\\nAsia-Pacific and focused growth in the Americas\\n−Diversification of intermediary coverage towards high growth channels and deployment of digital solutions to serve new\\nchannels\\n−Further efficiency through improved core operating processes, platform optimization and product rationalization\\n−Anticipation of further headwinds in the asset management industry as a result of the changing regulatory environment\\nUncertainty associated with key assumptions and potential events/circumstances that could have a negative effect: \\n−Challenging market environment and volatility unfavourable to our investment strategies\\n−Unfavourable margin development and adverse competition levels in key markets and products beyond expected levels\\n−Business/execution risks, e.g., under achievement of net flow targets from market uncertainty, loss of high quality client facing\\nemployees, unfavourable investment performance, lower than expected efficiency gains\\n−Uncertainty around regulation and its potential implications not yet anticipated\\nSensitivities: In order to test the resilience of the recoverable amount, key assumptions used in the DCF model (for example, the \\ndiscount rate and the earnings projections) are sensitized. Management believes that no reasonable changes in key assumptions \\ncould cause an impairment loss.

Due to the \\nspecific nature of these intangible assets, market prices are ordinarily not observable and, therefore, the Group values such \\nassets based on the income approach, using a post-tax DCF methodology.  \\nThe Group reviews the useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized each reporting period to determine whether \\nevents and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for these assets. If they do not, the change in \\nthe useful life assessment from indefinite to finite life will be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance \\nwith IAS 8 “Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”.  \\nIndefinite life intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if there are indications that \\nthe carrying value may be impaired. If any indicators exists, further assessment is made to determine if the carrying value may be \\nimpaired. \\nRetail investment management agreements – These assets, amounting to € 706 million, relate to the Group’s U.S. retail \\nmutual fund business. Retail investment management agreements are contracts that give DWS Group the exclusive right to \\nmanage a variety of mutual funds for a specified period. Since these contracts have a long history of renewal at minimal cost, \\nthese agreements are not expected to have a foreseeable limit on the contract period. Therefore, the rights to manage the \\nassociated assets under management are expected to generate cash flows for an indefinite period of time. This intangible asset \\nwas recorded at fair value based upon a valuation provided by a third party at the date of acquisition of Zurich Scudder \\nInvestments, Inc. in 2002.  \\nThe recoverable amount was calculated as fair value less costs of disposal using the multi-period excess earnings method and \\nthe fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and is essentially flat compared to the carrying \\namount. The key assumptions in determining the fair value less costs of disposal include the asset mix, the flows forecast, the \\neffective fee rate and discount rate as well as the terminal value growth rate. The discount rate (cost of equity) applied in the \\ncalculation was 10.3% in 2020 (9.8% in 2019). The terminal value growth rate applied for 2020 is 4.1% (for 2019 4.1%). The \\nreview of valuation for the years 2020 and 2019 neither resulted in any impairment nor a reversal of prior impairments.

These will then be transferred to the respective asset class once construction has been completed. \\nThere are no items of property and equipment subject to restrictions on title or which have been pledged as security against \\nliabilities. There are no commitments for the acquisition of property and equipment as at December 31, 2020. \\nAll classes of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost. Subsequent measurement \\nfollows as cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation occurs on a straight line basis over the \\nasset’s useful economic life. As at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 there were no impairments of Property and \\nEquipment.

Some lease contracts \\ninclude options to extend the lease by a defined amount of time, price adjustment clauses and escalation clauses in line with \\ngeneral office rental market conditions. The lease agreements do not include any clauses that impose any restriction on Group ’s \\nability to pay dividends, engage in debt financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements and do not include any \\nresidual value guarantees.

Due to national lockdowns and regional \\nrestrictions on work/travel, these offices hadn’t been at peak utilisation during the year. This is expected to continue for  the \\nduration of the leases on these premises into 2021. The Group has therefore recognised an impairment of €  1 million on the \\ncorresponding right-of-use assets for these locations in 2020. There was no impairment of right-of -use assets in 2019.  \\nThe additions and disposals during the year mainly reflect office movements in Asia-Pacific and Americas as part of the Group’s \\nlocation strategy.  \\nAmounts recognised in profit or loss \\nLeases under IFRS 16 \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n 2020\\n \\n2019\\n \\n\\nInterest expense on lease liabilities\\n \\n 2\\n \\n5\\n \\n\\nIncome\\n \\nfrom sub\\n-\\nleasing right\\n-\\nof\\n-\\nuse assets presented in other income\\n \\n 0\\n \\n0\\n \\n\\nExpenses relating to short\\n-\\nterm leases\\n \\n 0\\n \\n3\\n \\n\\nThe Group does not have expenses relating to short-term leases under the recognition exemption for 2020 (2019: €  3 million). \\nAmounts recognised in 2019 were shown within general and administrative expenses. These contracts had expired in 2019 and \\nwere not extended. The Group has no low-value assets where the exemption under IFRS 16 can be applied. \\nAmounts recognised in statement of cash flows \\nThe total cash outflow for leases was €  18 million for 2020 (2019: € 35 million) and represented mainly expenditures made for \\nreal estate rentals. Of the total amount, payments of €  16 million (2019: € 27 million) were made for the principal portion of lease \\nliabilities, payments of € 2 million (2019: € 5 million) were made for the interest portion. In addition, there were no payments for \\nleases not reflected on the balance sheet (2019: €  3 million).  \\nExtension options and leases not yet commenced but committed \\nMost property leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group by providing prior written notice to the landlord before \\nthe end of the lease. This notice period ranges from 18 months to 90 days before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. \\nIn certain rare instances, leases will renew automatically unless prior written notice is provided.  \\nWhere practical, the Group will seek to include extension options in its leases for operational flexibility. \\nAll options are exercisable by the Group and not the lessors. At commencement date, the Group assess whether it is reasonably \\ncertain to exercise any extension options. If so, these are included in the initial measurement of associated lease liabilities. \\nThe following table shows the future cash outflows  to which the Group as a lessee is potentially exposed that are not reflected in \\nthe measurement of the lease liabilities.   \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Dec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n\\nFuture cash outflows not reflected in lease liabilities:\\n \\n\\nNot \\nlater than one year\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nLater than one year and not later than five years\\n \\n 10\\n \\n12\\n \\n\\nLater than five years\\n \\n 123\\n \\n150\\n \\n\\nTotal future cash outflows not reflected in lease liabilities\\n \\n 134\\n \\n163\\n \\n\\nLeases as Lessor \\nFinance lease \\nThe Group reflects finance lease contracts within loans at amortized costs.

The business in scope of the transaction relates to two Lux-\\nembourg domiciled SICAV vehicles (DB Platinum and DB Platinum IV) with six hedge fund UCITS sub-funds and approximately € \\n2 billion of AuM. Upon completion of the sale of this business, the management company (DWS Investment S.A.) ceased to be \\nresponsible for managing the DB Platinum and DB Platinum IV SICAV’s but continues to carry out all its other activities. The \\ntransaction received regulatory approval on November 19, 2019 and was completed on January 11, 2020.

As of December 31, 2020, the Group’s balance of liabilities associated with commission and fee \\nincome was € 138 million (€ 179 million as of December 31, 2019). The Group has no contract liabilities as of December 31, 2020 \\nand as of December 31, 2019 respectively which arise from the Group’s obligation to prov ide future services to a customer for \\nwhich it has received consideration from the customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and \\nliabilities do not vary significantly from period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service \\ncontracts with service periods of less than one year such as monthly and quarterly asset management services. Customer \\npayment in exchange for services provided are generally subject to performance by the Group over the specific service period \\nsuch that the Group’s right to payment arises at the end of the service period when its performance obligations are fully \\ncompleted.  \\n\\n20 – Provisions \\nMovements by class of provision \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Operational\\n \\n\\nrisk\\n \\nCivil\\n \\n\\nlitigations\\n \\nRestruc\\nturing \\n-\\n \\n\\nstaff related\\n \\nOther\\n \\nTotal\\n \\n\\nBalance as of January 1, 2019\\n \\n 7\\n \\n5\\n \\n2\\n \\n28\\n \\n42\\n \\n\\nNew provisions\\n \\n 2\\n \\n1\\n \\n33\\n \\n5\\n \\n40\\n \\n\\nAmounts used\\n \\n 1\\n \\n3\\n \\n20\\n \\n22\\n \\n46\\n \\n\\nUnused amounts reversed\\n \\n 4\\n \\n2\\n \\n10\\n \\n4\\n \\n20\\n \\n\\nEffects from exchange rate \\nfluctuations/unwind of discount\\n \\n0\\n \\n0\\n \\n(2\\n)\\n \\n0\\n \\n(1\\n)\\n \\n\\nBalance as of December 31, 2019\\n \\n 4\\n \\n1\\n \\n3\\n \\n6\\n \\n15\\n \\n\\nNew provisions\\n \\n 8\\n \\n0\\n \\n8\\n \\n6\\n \\n22\\n \\n\\nAmounts used\\n \\n 3\\n \\n1\\n \\n11\\n \\n5\\n \\n19\\n \\n\\nUnused amounts reversed\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n0\\n \\n0\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nEffects from exchange \\nrate fluctuations/unwind of discount\\n \\n0\\n \\n(0\\n)\\n \\n(0\\n)\\n \\n(0\\n)\\n \\n(0\\n)\\n \\n\\nBalance as of December 31, 2020\\n \\n 9\\n \\n0\\n \\n1\\n \\n7\\n \\n17\\n \\n\\nProvisions are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event and when there is a probable outflow of \\nresources whose amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are recognized at the probable settlement value. The probable \\namount required to settle noncurrent provisions is discounted if the effect of discounting is material. In this case, the provision is \\nrecognized at present. The provisions recognized by the Group are considered short-term nature with the expectation of usage \\nover the next year.\\nClasses of Provisions \\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external \\nevents. The definition used for the purposes of determining operational provisions differs from the risk management definition, as \\nit excludes risk of loss resulting from civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters. For risk management purposes, \\noperational risk includes legal risk, as payments to customers, counterparties and regulatory bodies in civil litigations or regulatory \\nenforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings, but excludes business and reputational risk.  \\nCivil litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with contractual or other \\nlegal or regulatory responsibilities, which have resulted or may result in demands from customers, counterparties or other parties \\nin civil litigations.  \\nRestructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its long-term competitiveness through \\nreductions in costs, duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see note 8 ‘Restructuring’.  \\nOther provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances and provisions for regulatory \\nenforcement. In December 2019 the provision for the right to tender on a closed-end fund in the amount of € 19 million was partly \\nused and released.  \\nProvisions and Contingent Liabilities \\nThe Group recognises a provision for potential loss only when there is a present obligation arising from a past event that is \\nprobable to result in an economic outflow that can be reliably estimated. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made for such a n \\nobligation, no provision is recognised and the obligation is deemed a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities also include  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n-\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet\\n  \\n\\nProvisions\\n \\n\\n172\\n \\npossible obligations for which the possibility of future economic outflow is more than remote but less than probable. Where a \\nprovision has been taken for a particular claim, no contingent liability is recorded; for matters or sets of matters consisting of more \\nthan one claim, however, provisions may be recorded for some claims, and contingent liabilities (or neither a provision nor a \\ncontingent liability) may be recorded for others.  \\nThe Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement. As  a \\nresult, the Group may be involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and investigations. Where that is the case, \\nin determining for which of these matters the possibility of a loss is probable, or less than probable but more than remote,  and \\nthen estimating the possible loss for those claims, the Group takes into consideration a number of factors, including but not \\nlimited to the nature of the claim and its underlying facts, the procedural posture and litigation history of each case, rulings by the \\ncourts or tribunals, the Group’s experience and the experience of  others in similar cases (to the extent this is known to the \\nGroup), prior settlement discussions, settlements by others in similar cases (to the extent this is known to the Group), available \\nindemnities and the opinions and views of legal counsel and other experts.  \\nThe provisions the Group has recognised for civil litigation as of December 31, 2020 are set forth in the table above. For some \\nmatters for which the Group believes an outflow of funds is probable, no provisions were recognised as the Group could not \\nreliably estimate the amount of the potential outflow.  \\nFor the matters for which a reliable estimate can be made, the Group currently estimates that, as of December 31, 2020, there \\nwere no material contingent liabilities (i.e., the aggregate future loss of which the possibility is more than remote but less than \\nprobable) in relation to litigation or arbitration proceedings, or regulatory investigations in which the Group is involved.  \\nThis estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, is based upon currently available information and is subject to \\nsignificant judgment and a variety of assumptions, variables and known and unknown uncertainties. These uncertainties may \\ninclude inaccuracies in or incompleteness of the information available to the Group, particularly at the preliminary stages of \\nmatters, and assumptions by the Group as to future rulings of courts or other tribunals or the likely actions or positions taken by \\nregulators or adversaries may prove incorrect. Moreover, estimates of possible loss for these matters are often not amenable to \\nthe use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools frequently used in making judgments and estimates, and are subject to \\neven greater degrees of uncertainty than in many other areas where the Group must exercise judgment and make estimates. The \\nestimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, can be and often are substantially less than the amount initially \\nrequested by regulators or adversaries or the maximum potential loss that could be incurred were the matters to result in a final \\nadjudication adverse to the Group. Moreover, in certain regions in which the Group operates, an adversary may not be required \\nto set forth the amount it is seeking, and where it is, the amount may not be subject to the same requirements that generally apply \\nto pleading factual allegations or legal claims. \\nThe matters for which the Group determines that the possibility of a future loss is more than remote will change from time to time, \\nas will the matters as to which a reliable estimate can be made and the estimated possible loss for such matters. Actual results \\nmay prove to be significantly higher or lower than the estimate of possible loss in those matters where such an estimate was \\nmade. In addition, loss may be incurred in matters with respect to which the Group believed the likelihood of loss was remote. In \\nparticular, the estimated aggregate possible loss does not represent the Group’s potential maximum loss exposure for those \\nmatters.  \\nThe Group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations prior to a final judgment or determination of liability. It \\nmay do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing t o \\ncontest liability, even when the Group believes it has valid defences to liability. It may also do so when the potential \\nconsequences of failing to prevail would be disproportionate to the costs of settlement. Furthermore, the Group may, for similar \\nreasons, reimburse counterparties for their losses even in situations where it does not believe that it is legally compelled to do so. \\nCurrent Individual Proceedings \\nBy the nature of our business, the Group is involved in litigation and arbitration proceedings and regulatory investigations, but \\nnone of such proceedings is currently expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s financials.

This plan represents a contingent right to \\nreceive a cash payment by referencing to the value of DWS shares during a specified time period. \\nIn September 2018 one-off IPO related awards under the  DWS Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan  were granted to all DWS \\nemployees. A limited number of DWS senior managers were granted a one-off IPO related Performance Share Unit (PSU) under \\nthe DWS Equity Plan instead. For members of the Executive Board, one-off IPO related awards under the DWS Equity Plan \\nwere granted in January 2019. \\nThe DWS SAR Plan represents a contingent right to receive a cash payment equal to any appreciation (or gain) in the value of a \\nset number of notional DWS shares over a fixed period of time. This award does not provide any entitlement to receive DWS \\nshares, voting rights or associated dividends. \\nThe DWS Equity Plan is a phantom share plan representing a contingent right to receive a cash payment by referencing to the \\nvalue of DWS shares during a specified period of time.  \\nThe award recipient for any share-based compensation plan is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period of the \\naward. \\nThe share awards granted under the terms and conditions of any share-based compensation plan are forfeited fully or partly if the \\nrecipient voluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period (or the end of the retention period for \\nUpfront Awards). Vesting usually continues after termination of employment in cases such as redundancy or retirement.

SAR \\nAwards which were not exercised continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the DWS SAR Plan Rules, including \\nforfeiture provisions.  \\nIn addition, the PSU Award has performance conditions which will determine the nominal amount which can ultimately vest under \\nthe award. These performance conditions are linked to the Group strategy, specifically with regards to the target for net inflows \\nand the adjusted cost income ratio. Based on the outcome of the performance conditions tested following the end of full year \\n2020, it was confirmed that 100% of the units originally granted remain subject to continued vesting.  \\nDB Equity Plan (equity-settled) \\nThe Group employees continue to participate in the DB Equity Plan under the rules established for Deutsche Bank Group as \\napplicable.  \\nDB Group made grants of share-based compensation under the DB Equity Plan. This plan represents a contingent right to \\nreceive Deutsche Bank AG common shares after a specified period of time. The award recipient is not entitled to receive \\ndividends during the vesting period of the award. \\nThe share awards granted under the terms and conditions of the DB Equity Plan may be forfeited fully or partly if the recipient \\nvoluntarily terminates employment before the end of the relevant vesting period. Vesting usually continues after termination of \\nemployment in cases such as redundancy or retirement. \\nIn countries where legal or other restrictions hinder the delivery of shares, a cash plan variant of the DB Equity Plan was used for \\ngranting awards.

The rules are the same as those established for DB Group. The GSPP offers employees in \\nspecific countries the opportunity to purchase Deutsche Bank shares in monthly instalments over one year. At the end of the \\npurchase cycle, the acquired stock is matched in a ratio of one to one up to a maximum of ten free shares, provided that the \\nemployee remains at Deutsche Bank Group for another year.

These plans are sponsored \\neither by the Group directly or by other entities of DB Group and include both defined contribution plans and defined benefit \\nplans. These plans are accounted for based on the nature and substance of the plan. Generally, for defined benefit plans the \\nvalue of a participant’s accrued benefit is based on each employee’s remuneration and length of service; contributions to defined \\ncontribution plans are typically based on a percentage of each employee’s remuneration. The remainder of this note focuses \\npredominantly on the Group’s defined benefit plans.  \\nThe defined benefit plans are described on a geographical basis, reflecting differences in the nature and risks of benefits, as well \\nas in the respective regulatory environments. In particular, the requirements set by local regulators can vary significantly and \\nbroadly determine the design and financing of the benefit plans. Key information is also shown based on participant status, which \\nprovides an indication of the maturity of the Group’s obligations.  \\n\\nDec 31, 2020\\n \\n\\nin € m.

Outside of Germany, the largest obligations r elate \\nto Switzerland and Luxembourg. In Germany, post-employment benefits are usually agreed on a collective basis with respective \\nemployee workers councils. The Group’s main pension plans are governed by boards of trustees, fiduciaries or their equivalent .  \\nPost-employment benefits can form an important part of an employee’s total remuneration. The Group follows the approach that \\ntheir design shall be attractive to employees in the respective market, but sustainable over the longer term. At the same time, the  DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nAdditional Notes\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Employee Benefits\\n  \\n\\n180\\n \\nGroup tries to limit its risks related to provision of such benefits. Consequently the Group has moved to offer defined contr ibution \\nplans in many locations over recent years.  \\nHistorically, pension plans were typically based on final pay prior to retirement. These types of benefits still form a significant part \\nof the pension obligations for participants in deferred and payment status. Currently, in Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg, \\nthe main defined benefit pension plans for active staff are cash account type plans where the Group credits an annual amount to \\nindividuals’ accounts based on an employee’s current salary. Dependent  on the plan rules, the accounts increase either at a fixed \\ninterest rate or participate in market movements of certain underlying investments to limit the associated investment risk. \\nSometimes, in particular in Germany, there is a guaranteed benefit amount within the plan rules, e.g. payment of at least the \\namounts contributed. Upon retirement, beneficiaries may usually opt for a lump sum or for conversion of the accumulated account \\nbalance into an annuity. This conversion is often based on market conditions and mortality assumptions at retirement. \\nThe following amounts of expected benefit payments by the Group in respect of defined benefit plans include benefits attributable \\nto employees’ past and estimated future service, and include both amounts paid fro m external pension trusts and paid directly by \\nthe Group in respect of unfunded plans. \\n\\nin € m.

Generally the risk associated to the plan is within the sponsoring entity while the Group entities are obliged to pay for \\ncosts incurred for their respective employees within the sponsoring entity. \\nIn Germany, the Group is a member of the BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G. (BVV) together with other financial \\ninstitutions. The BVV, pension provider for Germany’s financial industry, offers retirement benefits to eligible employees in  \\nGermany as a complement to post-employment benefit commitments of the Group. Both employers and employees contribute on \\na regular basis to the BVV. The BVV provides annuities of a fixed amount to individuals on retirement and increases these fix ed \\namounts if surplus assets arise within the plan. Under legislation in Germany, the employer is ultimately liable for providing the \\nbenefits to its employees. An increase in benefits may also arise due to additional obligations to retirees for the effects of inflation. \\nBVV is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. In line with industry practice, the Group accounts for these benefits as a defined \\ncontribution plan since insufficient information is available to identify assets and liabilities relating to the Group’s curr ent and \\nformer employees because the BVV does not fully allocate plan assets to beneficiaries or to member companies. According to \\nthe BVV’s most recent disclosures, there is no current deficit in the plan that may affect the amount of future Group contrib utions. \\nFurthermore, any plan surplus emerging in the future will be distributed to the plan members, hence it cannot reduce future Group \\ncontributions.  \\nGovernance and Risk \\nOversight for the Group’s pension plans is performed by the Risk and Control Committee  (RCC), as mandated by the Executive \\nBoard in November 2019 to oversee its pension and related risks on a global basis. This committee meets monthly and is \\nsupported by a Pension Working Group which was established in the 4 th quarter of 2019. The RCC is mandated to take oversight \\nwith regards to guidelines for funding, asset allocation, actuarial assumption setting and risk management. In this regard, risk \\nmanagement includes the management and control of risks for the Group related to market developments (e.g. interest rate, \\ncredit spread, price inflation), asset investment, regulatory or legislative requirements, as well as monitoring demographic \\nchanges (e.g. longevity). While exercising this oversight the Group leverages DB Group’s pension oversight and  operative control \\nmechanism implemented, in particular during and after acquisitions or changes in the external environment (e.g. legislation, \\ntaxation), topics such as the general plan design or potential plan amendments are considered. To the extent that pension plans \\nare funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risks, but introduce investment risk.   DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nAdditional Notes\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Employee Benefits\\n  \\n\\n181\\n \\nIn key pension countries, the Group’s largest post -employment benefit plan risk exposures relate to potential changes in credit \\nspreads, interest rates, price inflation and longevity, although these have been partially mitigated through the investment strategy \\nadopted. \\nOverall, the Group is seeking to minimize the impact of pensions on its financial position from market movements, subject to \\nbalancing the trade-offs involved in financing post-employment benefits, regulatory capital and constraints from local funding or \\naccounting requirements. DB Group measures pension risk exposures on a regular basis using specific metrics developed for thi s \\npurpose. This process covers DB Group overall, which includes the Group’s exposures. The Group has reviewed the annual plan \\nobligations for 2020.  \\nFunding \\nIn 2019 the Group has reviewed DB Group’s funding principle and introduced updated funding principles. V arious external \\npension trusts are maintained to fund the majority of the Group’s defined benefit plan obligations. The Group’s funding princ iple, \\nis to maintain coverage of the defined benefit obligation by plan assets within a range of 80% to 100% of the obligation, subject to \\nmeeting any local statutory requirements. The Group has also determined that certain plans should remain unfunded, although \\ntheir funding approach is subject to periodic review, e.g. when local regulations or practices change. Obligations for any unfunded \\nplans are accrued on the balance sheet as necessary.  \\nFor most of the externally funded defined benefit plans there are local minimum funding requirements, however, the Group can \\ndecide on any additional plan contributions based on  Group’s funding principles noted earlier. In most countries the Group \\nexpects to receive an economic benefit from any plan surpluses of plan assets compared to defined benefit obligations, typically \\nby way of reduced future contributions. Given the broadly fully funded position and the investment strategy adopted in the \\nGroup’s key funded defined benefit plans, any minimum funding requirements that may apply are not expected to place the \\nGroup under any material adverse cash strain in the short term. With r eference to DB Group’s funding principle, the Group \\nconsiders not re-claiming benefits paid from the Group’s assets as an equivalent to making cash contributions into the external \\npension trusts during the year.  \\nActuarial Methodology and Assumptions \\nDecember 31 is the measurement date for all plans. All plans are valued by independent qualified actuaries using the projected \\nunit credit method. DWS Group has reviewed DB Group policy which provides guidance to local actuaries to ensure consistency \\nglobally on setting actuarial assumptions and considers these assumptions to be appropriate. \\nThe key actuarial assumptions applied in determining the defined benefit obligations at December 31 are presented below in the \\nform of weighted averages. \\n\\nDec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec\\n \\n31, 2019\\n \\n\\nGermany\\n \\nEMEA (excl. \\n\\nGermany & UK)\\n \\nAPAC\\n \\nGermany\\n \\nEMEA (excl. \\n\\nGermany & UK)\\n \\nAPAC\\n \\n\\nDiscount rate (in %)\\n \\n 0.66\\n \\n0.28\\n \\n1.38\\n \\n1.02\\n \\n0.54\\n \\n0.91\\n \\n\\nRate of price inflation (in %)\\n \\n1.25\\n \\n1.05\\n \\n1.60\\n \\n1.35\\n \\n1.14\\n \\n1.60\\n \\n\\nRate of nominal \\nincrease in future compensation levels \\n\\n(in %)\\n \\n 1.75\\n \\n1.50\\n \\n3.66\\n \\n1.85\\n \\n1.58\\n \\n3.63\\n \\n\\nRate of nominal increase for pensions in payment (in %)\\n \\n1.15\\n \\n0.43\\n \\n0.0\\n \\n1.25\\n \\n0.47\\n \\n0.0\\n \\n\\nAssumed life expectancy at age 65:\\n \\n\\nFor a \\nmale aged 65 at measurement date\\n \\n21.2\\n \\n21.7\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n21.1\\n \\n21.6\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n\\nFor a female aged 65 at measurement date\\n \\n23.5\\n \\n23.8\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n23.4\\n \\n23.7\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n\\nFor a male aged 45 at measurement date\\n \\n22.5\\n \\n23.4\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n22.4\\n \\n23.3\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n\\nFor a female aged 45\\n \\nat measurement date\\n \\n24.6\\n \\n25.4\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n24.5\\n \\n25.3\\n \\nN/A\\n \\n\\nMortality tables applied\\n \\nmodified\\n \\n\\nRichttafeln\\n \\n\\nHeubeck\\n \\n\\n2018G\\n \\nCountry\\n \\n\\nspecific\\n \\n\\ntables\\n \\nN/A\\n \\nmodified\\n \\n\\nRichttafeln\\n \\n\\nHeubeck\\n \\n\\n2018G\\n \\nCountry\\n \\n\\nspecific\\n \\n\\ntables\\n \\nN/A\\n \\nIn 2019, DWS Group changed its rounding principles such that for all significant financial assumptions, the derived annual rate \\nwill be rounded up or down to the nearest 0.01%.

For other countries, the price inflation assumptions are typically based on long \\nterm forecasts by Consensus Economics Inc. \\nThe discount rate and inflation rate assumptions in the Eurozone  are key drivers to the Group’s pension obligations. During 2020, \\na review was conducted on the methodology to set these assumptions and various refinements were implemented over the year. \\nThe combined effect of these refinements, reflected in Other Compreh ensive Income, reduced the Group’s overall pension \\nobligations at December 31, 2020 in the Eurozone by around €21m relative to the approach adopted at December 31, 2019.  \\nThe assumptions for the increases in future compensation levels and for increases to pension payments are developed \\nseparately for each plan, where relevant. Each is set based on the price inflation assumption and reflecting DWS Group’s rewa rd \\nstructure or policies in each market, as well as relevant local statutory and plan-specific requirements. \\nAmong other assumptions, mortality assumptions can be significant in measuring DWS Group’s obligations under its defined \\nbenefit plans. These assumptions have been set in accordance with current best estimate in the respective countries. Future \\npotential improvements in longevity have been considered and included where appropriate. \\nIn 2019 the Group decided to apply Deutsche Bank specific mortality assumptions used to determine the defined benefit \\nobligation for its defined benefit pension plans in Germany. In this context -based on actuarial calculations for the DB specific \\npopulation- the bank adjusted the mortality expectations from the so far used “Richttafeln Heubeck 2018G” to the DB specific \\nmortality experience of employees and pensioners. Thi s change in actuarial assumptions led to an actuarial loss of € 2.7 million \\nbefore taxes as of December 31, 2019 and is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the line item \\nre-measurement gains (losses).

The investment objective  is to protect against adverse impacts of \\nchanges in the funding position of its defined benefit pension plans on key financial metrics, with a primary focus on immunizing the \\nplans’ IFRS funded status, while taking into account the plans’ impact on other m etrics, such as regulatory capital and local profit or  DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nAdditional Notes\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Employee Benefits\\n  \\n\\n185\\n \\nloss accounts. The Group reverted to the IFRS driven investment strategy in 2019. Investment managers manage pension assets i n \\nline with investment mandates or guidelines as agreed with the pension pla ns’ trustees and investment committees.  \\nTo achieve the primary objective of immunizing the IFRS funded status of key defined benefit plans, a liability driven investment (LDI) \\napproach is applied. Risks from mismatches between fluctuations in the present value of the defined benefit obligations and plan \\nassets due to capital market movements are minimized, subject to balancing relevant trade-offs. This is achieved by allocating plan \\nassets closely to the market risk factor exposures of the pension liability to interest rates, credit spreads and inflation. Thereby, plan \\nassets broadly reflect the underlying risk profile and currency of the pension obligations.  \\nWhere the desired hedging level for these risks cannot be achieved with physical instruments (i.e. corporate and government bonds), \\nderivatives are employed. Derivative overlays mainly include interest rate, inflation swaps and credit default swaps. Other \\ninstruments are also used, such as interest rate futures and options. In practice, a completely hedged approach is impractical \\nbecause of insufficient market depth for ultra- long-term corporate bonds, as well as liquidity and cost considerations.

There is neither a material amount of securities issued \\nby DWS Group nor other claims against DWS Group assets included in the fair value of plan assets. The plan assets do not \\ninclude any real estate which is used by DWS Group. \\nIn addition, DWS Group estimates and allows for uncertain income tax positions which may have an impact on DWS Group’s plan \\nassets. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates  and DWS Group’s final liabilities may ultimately be materially \\ndifferent. \\nKey Risk Sensitivities \\nDWS Group’s defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in capital market conditions and actuarial assumptions. \\nSensitivities to capital market movements and key assumption changes are presented in the following table. Each market risk \\nfactor or assumption is changed in isolation. Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligations are approximated using geometric \\nextrapolation methods based on plan durations for the respective assumption. Duration is a risk measure that indicates the broad \\nsensitivity of the obligations to a change in an underlying assumption and provides a reasonable approximation for small to \\nmoderate changes in those assumptions. \\nFor example, the interest rate duration is derived from the change in the defined benefit obligation to a change in the interest rate \\nbased on information provided by the local actuaries of the respective plans. The resulting duration is used to estimate the \\nremeasurement liability loss or gain from changes in the interest rate. For other assumptions, a similar approach is used to derive \\nthe respective sensitivity results. \\nFor defined benefit pension plans, changes in capital market conditions will impact the plan obligations via actuarial assumptions \\n–mainly interest rate and price inflation rate – as well as the plan assets. Where DWS Group applies a LDI approach, the overall\\nexposure to changes is reduced. Consequently, to aid understanding of DWS Group’s risk  exposures related to key capital\\nmarket movements, the net impact of the change in the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to a change of the related\\nmarket risk factor or underlying actuarial assumption is shown; for sensitivities to changes in actuarial assumptions that do not\\nimpact the plan assets, only the impact on the defined benefit obligations is shown.\\nAsset-related sensitivities are derived for major plans which are applicable to DWS Group by using risk sensitivity factors \\ndetermined by DB Group’s Market Risk Management function. These sensitivities are calculated based on information provided \\nby the plans’ investment managers and extrapolated linearly to reflect the approximate change of the plan assets’ market valu e in \\ncase of a change in the underlying risk factor. \\nThe sensitivities illustrate plausible variations over time in capital market movements and key actuarial assumptions. DWS Gr oup \\nis not in a position to provide a view on the likelihood of these capital market or assumption changes. While these sensitivities \\nillustrate the overall impact on the funded status of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of \\nreasonable possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the aggregated results. Even \\nthough plan assets and plan obligations are sensitive to similar risk factors, actual changes in plan assets and obligations may \\nnot fully offset each other due to imperfect correlations between market risk factors and actuarial assumptions. Caution should be \\nused when extrapolating these sensitivities due to non-linear effects that changes in capital market conditions and key actuarial  DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nAdditional Notes\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Employee Benefits\\n  \\n\\n188\\n \\nassumptions may have on the overall funded status.

This is based on management’s \\nassessment that it is probable that the respective entities will have taxable profits against which the unused tax losses, unused \\ntax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Generally, in determining the amounts of deferred tax assets to \\nbe recognized, management uses historical profitability information and, if relevant, forecasted operating results, based upo n \\napproved business plans, including a review of the eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant \\nconsiderations.  \\nAs of December 31, 2020, DWS Group had temporary differences associated with the Group’s parent company’s investments in \\nsubsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures of € 111 million (2019: €  121 million), in respect of which no \\ndeferred tax liabilities were recognized. \\n\\n25 – Related Party Transactions \\nRelated parties are considered as a person or entity who has the ability to directly or indirectly control the other party or exercise \\nsignificant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions.

These entities are classified as structured entities. Structured entities may be \\nestablished as corporations, trusts or partnerships. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt or \\nequity securities that are collateralised by and/or indexed to the assets held by the structured entities.  \\nGuaranteed Funds \\nThe Group manages guaranteed funds, which provide a full or partial notional guarantee at a date specific in the respective \\nguaranteed contract (guarantee date). These funds are consol idated by the Group under IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial \\nStatements” due to the fact it has power (being the asset manager), is exposed to variable returns (specifically via the guar antee) \\nand can use its power to affect those returns. In general, the Group has no stake in these funds.  Since investors can return their \\nfund shares on a daily basis and receive back the market value of their shares, the interests of the investors do not qualify as \\nequity and the Group recognizes a liability at amortized cost within other liabilities which reflects the implied fair value based on \\nthe assets held as trading assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. The assets held by the consolidated structur ed \\nentity are classified as trading assets in the balance sheet . \\nThe Group is exposed to a fall in value of the underlying fund or account below the guaranteed amount at the respective \\nguarantee date. The guaranteed product portfolios are managed using constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategies \\nand techniques, which use a rule based exposure allocation mechanism into highly rated assets and riskier assets, depending on \\nmarket levels. The risk for the Group as guarantor is that it has to compensate the funds if the market values of such products at \\ntheir respective guarantee dates are lower than the guaranteed levels (please refer to the ‘Risk Report –  Financial Risk’). \\nSeed Investments \\nSeed investments are deployed to build marketable track records for new products initiated by the Group. Seed investments are \\nmade to establish necessary funding for a new fund. Over time, seed investments are withdrawn as the funds grow and/or client s \\nmake investments in the funds. Seeded products typically comprise shares of mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) o r \\nequity interests in other types of commingled vehicles. The underlying exposure is comprised of varying asset types (typicall y \\nfixed income or equity securities with active primary and secondary markets). The duration of deployed seed capital is typica lly up \\nto three years. The Group consolidates these structured entities typically when setting up as the Group has the ability to exercise \\nits power in order to affect any variable returns. The Group deconsolidate those funds when losing the power to control in order to \\naffect any variable returns that the Group is exposed to through its involvement with the entity (please refer note 2 ‘Signif icant \\nAccounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates’).   \\nThe Group executes an economic risk position offset program to minimize the profit/loss volatility of the seed investment portfolio \\n(please refer to the ‘Risk Report – Financial Risk’). \\nCo-Investments \\nThe Group has direct investments in co-investments primarily in structured entities that invest in a variety of asset classes, \\nincluding (but not limited to), equities, fixed income, commodities and other alternative asset classes which may include rea l \\nestate, infrastructure, private equity and hedge funds. Investments are made to ensure an alignment of interest with the \\nmanagement of the respective funds. Co-investment capital is subject to investment market movements. The diversity of the \\ninvestment portfolio across investment classes (real estate, infrastructure and private equity) and geographies, plus the long term \\nnature of these investments (five to ten years in most cases) provides portfolio diversification against material negative fair value \\n(please refer to ‘Risk Report – Financial Risk’ within this report).  \\nConsolidated Structured Entities \\nStructured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entities \\nindicates that the structured entities are controlled by the Group, as discussed in note  2 ‘Significant Accounting Policies and  DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nAdditional Notes\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Structured Entities\\n  \\n\\n198\\n \\nCritical Accounting Estimates’. The most significant judgment in assessing whether the Group has control of a structured entity is \\nthe determination whether the Group exercises its power as a principal rather than as an agent in respect of the fund it manages. \\nThe fund manager typically has power through investment management and other agreements. In assessing whether the Group \\nis an agent or a principal, it considers a number of factors, including the scope of its decision-making activities, rights held by the \\ninvestors and others and its exposure to variable returns including remuneration. The Group does not consolidate funds where it \\nis deemed to be an agent or when a third party investor has the ability to direct the activities of the fund. The size and maximum \\nexposure at risk is the net asset value of the consolidated structured entities. \\nThe Group has the following consolidated structured entities. \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Dec 31, 2020\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n\\nAssets:\\n \\n\\nGuaranteed funds\\n \\n 1,110\\n \\n1,354\\n \\n\\nSeed investments\\n \\n 232\\n \\n146\\n \\n\\nCo\\n-\\ninvestments\\n \\n 2\\n \\n2\\n \\n\\nTotal assets\\n \\n 1,344\\n \\n1,502\\n \\n\\nLiabilities:\\n \\n\\nGuaranteed funds\\n \\n 1,109\\n \\n1,345\\n \\n\\nSeed investments\\n \\n 65\\n \\n19\\n \\n\\nCo\\n-\\ninvestments\\n \\n 1\\n \\n0\\n \\n\\nTotal liabilities\\n \\n 1,175\\n \\n1,364\\n \\n\\nNet income (loss) attributable to DWS shareholders:\\n \\n\\nGuaranteed funds\\n \\n (2\\n)\\n \\n0\\n \\n\\nSeed investments\\n \\n 6\\n \\n7\\n \\n\\nCo\\n-\\ninvestments\\n \\n 0\\n \\n0\\n \\n\\nTotal net income (loss) attributable to DWS shareholders\\n \\n 5\\n \\n7\\n \\n\\nUnconsolidated Structured Entities \\nThese are structured entities which are not consolidated because the Group does not control them through voting rights, contract, \\nfunding agreements, or other means.  \\nInterests in Unconsolidated Structured Entities \\nThe Group’s interests in unconsolidated s tructured entities refer to contractual involvement that exposes the Group to variability \\nof returns from the performance of the structured entities. Examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt, \\ninvestment funds or equity investments (seed capital, co-investments and cash invested in money market funds), receivables \\nfrom asset management fees (shown in other assets) and certain derivative instruments in which the Group is absorbing \\nvariability of returns from the structured entities. \\nBelow is a description of the Group’s interest in unconsolidated structured entities by type:  \\nSecuritization \\nThe Group set up structured note vehicles with the primary objective to realize investment returns by investing in the debt of US \\ninfrastructure companies. The debt securitization assets held are classified as non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss.  \\nFunds  \\nThe Group sets up and manages various structured entities to accommodate client requirements to hold investments in specific \\nassets. Those assets including seed and co-investments are classified as non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value \\nthrough profit and loss as the Group’s business model assessment under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” resulted in “other \\nbusiness model”. \\nWhere we have an institutional mandate which is structured as a fund (e.g. German “Spezialfonds”) these have been considered \\nas structured entities.  DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nAdditional Notes\\n  \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Structured Entities\\n  \\n\\n199\\n \\nThe Group does not consolidate funds when the Group is deemed agent or when another third party investor has the ability to \\ndirect the activities of the fund. \\nIncome Derived from Involvement with Structured Entities  \\nThe Group earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment management service in relation \\nto funds. The majority of the net commission and fees from asset management activities and most of the net gains (losses) on \\nfinancial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss relates to structured entities. \\nMaximum Exposure to Unconsolidated Structured Entities \\nThe maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated structured entities. \\nThe maximum exposure for financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss, loans and other assets is reflect ed by \\ntheir carrying value in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure for derivatives under IFRS  12 “Disclosure of \\nInterests in Other Entities”, as interpreted by the Group, is reflected by the notional amounts of € 5,877 million as of \\nDecember 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 € 6,664 million). Such amounts or their development do not reflect the economic risks \\nfaced by DWS Group because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or economic hedges nor the probability of \\nsuch losses being incurred. Off-balance sheet commitments (unfunded commitments to funds) are reflected with their outstanding \\ncommitted amount at reporting date. The total maximum exposure is calculated by adding total assets, total off-balance sheet \\nexposure and notional amounts of derivatives.  \\nThe following table shows, by type of structured entity, the carrying amounts of the Group’s interests recognized in the \\nconsolidated financial statement and the maximum exposure. The decrease in non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss is mainly driven by a reduction of corporate cash invested into money market funds. \\nCarrying amounts and maximum exposure relating to the Group’s interests  \\n\\nDec 31, 2020\\n \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Securitizations\\n \\nFunds\\n \\nTotal\\n \\n\\nAssets:\\n \\n\\nCash and bank balances\\n \\n 0\\n \\n0\\n \\n0\\n \\n\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss:\\n \\n\\nNon\\n-\\ntrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss\\n \\n19\\n \\n676\\n \\n696\\n \\n\\nInvestment contract assets mandatory at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss\\n \\n0\\n \\n526\\n \\n526\\n \\n\\nTotal financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n \\n 19\\n \\n1,202\\n \\n1,222\\n \\n\\nOther assets\\n \\n 0\\n \\n157\\n \\n157\\n \\n\\nTotal assets\\n \\n 19\\n \\n1,359\\n \\n1,378\\n \\n\\nLiabilities:\\n \\n\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value\\n \\nthrough profit or loss:\\n \\n\\nNegative market values from derivative financial instruments\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nTotal financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nTotal liabilities\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nNotional amount of derivatives\\n \\n 0\\n \\n5,877\\n \\n5,877\\n \\n\\nOff\\n-\\nbalance sheet exposure\\n \\n 0\\n \\n128\\n \\n128\\n \\n\\nMaximum exposure\\n \\n 19\\n \\n7,364\\n \\n7,383\\n  DWS \\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nAdditional No\\n tes\\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n Events after the Reporting Period\\n  \\n\\n200\\n \\nDec 31, 2019\\n \\n\\nin € m.\\n \\n Securitizations\\n \\nFunds\\n \\nTotal\\n \\n\\nAssets:\\n \\n\\nCash and bank balances\\n \\n 0\\n \\n14\\n \\n14\\n \\n\\nTotal financial assets at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss:\\n \\n\\nNon\\n-\\ntrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss\\n \\n24\\n \\n922\\n \\n946\\n \\n\\nInvestment contract assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss\\n \\n0\\n \\n544\\n \\n544\\n \\n\\nTotal financial assets at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss\\n \\n 24\\n \\n1,466\\n \\n1,490\\n \\n\\nOther assets\\n \\n 0\\n \\n238\\n \\n238\\n \\n\\nTotal assets\\n \\n 24\\n \\n1,718\\n \\n1,742\\n \\n\\nLiabilities:\\n \\n\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss:\\n \\n\\nNegative market values from derivative \\nfinancial instruments\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nTotal financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nTotal liabilities\\n \\n 0\\n \\n1\\n \\n1\\n \\n\\nNotional amount of derivatives\\n \\n 0\\n \\n6,664\\n \\n6,664\\n \\n\\nOff\\n-\\nbalance sheet exposure\\n \\n 0\\n \\n119\\n \\n119\\n \\n\\nMaximum \\nexposure\\n \\n 24\\n \\n8,500\\n \\n8,525\\n \\n\\nFinancial Support \\nDuring 2020 and 2019 respectively, the Group did not provide non-contractual support to unconsolidated structured entities. \\nSponsored Unconsolidated Structured Entities where the Group has no Interest as of \\nDecember 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 \\nThe Group considers itself a sponsor of a structured entity when it is exposed to litigation risk from its involvement with a \\nstructured entity in which the Group does not have an interest.

KGaA, Frankfurt am Main \\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Summarized \\nManagement Report \\nOpinions \\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA and its subsidiaries (the Group), which \\ncomprise the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, the consolidated statement of income, the consolidated \\nstatement of comprehensive income, the consolidated changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the \\nfinancial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a \\nsummary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the summarized management report of DWS Group \\nGmbH & Co. KGaA for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. In accordance with German legal \\nrequirements, we have not audited the content of those components of the summarized management report specified in the \\n\"Other Information\" section of our auditor\\'s report. \\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, \\n–the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by\\nthe EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB\\n[Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair\\nview of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2020, and of its financial\\nperformance for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and\\n–the accompanying summarized management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group\\'s\\nposition. In all material respects, this summarized management report is consistent with the consolidated financial\\nstatements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of\\nfuture development. Our opinion on the summarized management report does not cover the content of those\\ncomponents of the summarized management report specified in the \"Other Information\" section of the auditor\\'s\\nreport.\\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal \\ncompliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the summarized management report. \\nBasis for the Opinions \\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the summarized management report in accordance with \\nSection 317 HGB and EU Audit Regulation No 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance \\nwith German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer \\n[Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described \\nin the \"Auditor\\'s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Summarized Management \\nReport\" section of our auditor\\'s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European \\nlaw and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nConfirmations\\n  \\n\\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\\n \\n\\n204\\n \\naccordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare \\nthat we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the \\nevidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial \\nstatements and on the summarized management report. \\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. These matters were addressed in the \\ncontext of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a \\nseparate opinion on these matters. \\nImpairment testing of goodwill \\nPlease refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied and \\nthe assumptions used. Disclosures on the amount of goodwill can be found under note 15 and information on the economic \\ndevelopment of the asset management industry is presented in the section \"Operating and Financial Review\" in the summarized \\nmanagement report. \\nTHE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK \\nAs of December 31, 2020, goodwill amounted to EUR 2,739 million and, at 26% of total assets, accounts for a substantial share \\nof assets. \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually at the level of the single operating segment. For this purpose, the carrying amount is \\ncompared with the recoverable amount of the business segment. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an \\nimpairment loss is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the \\nbusiness segment. The effective date for the impairment test is October 1, 2020. \\nImpairment testing of goodwill is complex and based on a range of assumptions that require judgment. These include the \\nexpected business and earnings development of the business segment for the next five years, the assumed long-term growth \\nrates and the discount rate used. \\nCompetition in the asset management industry continued to intensify in financial year 2020. Future business prospects continu e \\nto be negatively affected in particular by the continued compression of margins globally and rising costs of market entry. \\nNevertheless, DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA did not identify any need for impairment as a result of the impairment test carried \\nout. \\nThere is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that impairment existing as of the reporting date was not identified due \\nto improper determination of the parameters relevant for the evaluation. This includes the risk that improper application of the \\nfactors used to identify a single business segment led to an existing need to recognize impairment losses not being identified. \\nThere is also the risk that the related disclosures in the notes are not appropriate.  \\nOUR AUDIT APPROACH \\nWe assessed the proper application of the factors used to identify the individual business segment, in particular with regard to the \\nmanagement and reporting structures of the Group, the structure of the variable remuneration components of all the members of \\nthe Executive Board as well as a peer group analysis of other listed asset managers. We also assessed, with the help of our \\nvaluation specialists, the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and the calculation method used by the Company. To \\nthis end, we discussed the expected development of business and earnings as well as the assumed long-term growth rates with \\nthose responsible for planning. In addition, we reconciled this information with other internally available forecasts, e.g. the budget \\nprepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we evaluated the consistency of \\nassumptions with external market assessments. \\nFurther, we satisfied ourselves of the quality of the Company\\'s forecasts to date by comparing the budgets from previous financial \\nyears with the results actually achieved and by analyzing deviations. Since even minor changes to the discount rate can have  a \\nmaterial effect on the results of the impairment test, we compared the assumptions and parameters underlying the discount rate, \\nin particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor, with our own assumptions and publicly available data.  \\nWe verified the computational accuracy of the valuation model used by the Company. \\nIn order to take account of the existing forecast uncertainty and the earlier deadline selected for impairment testing, we examined \\nthe effects of possible changes in the discount rate, the earnings trend and the long-term growth rate on the recoverable amount \\n(sensitivity analysis), by calculating alternative scenarios and comparing them with the values stated by the Company.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nConfirmations\\n  \\n\\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\\n \\n\\n205\\n \\nFurthermore, we scrutinized the final analysis of the measurement results made by the Company, including the assessment of \\nthe relation between the recoverable amount and the carrying amount of equity and the market capitalization. \\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes regarding impairment of goodwill are appropriate. \\nOUR OBSERVATIONS \\nThe calculation method used for impairment testing of goodwill is appropriate and in line with the accounting policies to be \\napplied. The Company\\'s assumptions and parameters used for measurement are appropriately derived overall. The factors used \\nto identify a single business segment were applied appropriately. The related disclosures in the notes are appropriate. \\nImpairment testing of the \"Scudder\" intangible asset \\nPlease refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied and \\nthe assumptions used. Disclosures on the amount of other intangible assets can be found under note 15 and information on the \\neconomic development of the asset management industry is presented in the section \"Operating and Financial Review\" in the \\nsummarized management report. \\nTHE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK \\nAs of December 31, 2020, other intangible assets of EUR 706 million consist of contractual agreements granting temporary \\nexclusive rights to manage American mutual funds. In the course of the acquisition of Zurich Scudder Investments, Inc. concluded \\nin 2002, this intangible asset was first recognized in the consolidated financial statements of Deutsche Bank AG. These \\ncontractual arrangements can be extended without significant costs and, moreover, have a long history of extensions. The \\nCompany therefore recognized an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. \\nThe \"Scudder\" intangible asset is tested for impairment annually. For this purpose, the carrying amount is compared with the \\nrecoverable amount of the contractually agreed exclusive rights. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an \\nimpairment loss is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the \\ncontractually agreed exclusive rights. Goodwill was tested for impairment as of September 30, 2020. \\nThe impairment test of the \"Scudder\" intangible asset is complex and is based on a number of assumptions that require \\njudgment. These include the asset mix, the expected net changes in cash flows of the managed mutual funds, the effective fee \\nrate, the assumed long-term growth rates and the discount rate used. \\nAs a result of the impairment test performed, the Company did not identify any impairment. However, the Company\\'s sensitivity \\ncalculations showed that, among other things, a reasonably possible negative development in the expected net changes in cash \\nflows of the managed mutual funds or the effective fee rate would result in a writedown to the resulting recoverable amount. \\nThere is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that an impairment existing at the reporting date was not identified \\nbecause the valuation method was not implemented appropriately and in accordance with the applicable valuation principles and \\nthe assumptions and parameters underlying the valuation were not appropriately derived. There is also the risk that the related \\ndisclosures in the notes are not appropriate. \\nOUR AUDIT APPROACH \\nWe obtained an understanding of the Company\\'s process for deriving assumptions requiring judgment, identifying indications of \\nimpairment and determining recoverable amounts based on explanations provided by accounting staff. \\nWith the help of our valuation specialists, we assessed, among other things, the appropriateness of the Company\\'s calculation \\nmethod. To this end, we discussed the assumed long-term growth rates with those responsible for planning and assessed the \\nconsistency of the assumptions with external market assessments. \\nFurther, we satisfied ourselves of the quality of the Company\\'s forecasts to date by comparing the budgets from previous financial \\nyears with the results actually achieved and by analyzing deviations. We compared the assumptions and parameters underlying \\nthe discount rate, in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor, with our own assumptions and \\npublicly available data.  \\nIn order to take into account the existing forecasting uncertainty and the earlier date for the impairment test, we examined the \\neffects of possible changes in expected net changes in cash flows of the managed mutual funds, the effective fee rate and the \\nassumed long-term growth rates, or the discount rate used, on the recoverable amount by calculating alternative scenarios and \\ncomparing them with the Company\\'s figures (sensitivity analysis). \\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes on the recoverability of the \"Scudder\" intangible assets are appropriate.

The Company\\'s assumptions and parameters on which the valuation is based are generally \\nappropriate. The related disclosures in the notes are appropriate. \\nOther Information \\nManagement respectively the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the \\nfollowing components of the summarized management report, whose content was not audited: \\n- the integrated non-financial group statement, whose disclosures are marked as unaudited, and\\n- the corporate governance statement pursuant to sections 289f and 315d HGB, to which reference is made in the\\nsummarized management report.\\nThe other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual report. \\nThe other information does not include the audited consolidated financial statements, the summarized management report \\ninformation audited for content and our auditor\\'s report thereon. \\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the summarized management report do not cover the other \\ninformation, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other \\ninformation \\n–is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the summarized management report\\ninformation audited for content or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\\n–otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\\nIn accordance with our engagement, we have performed a separate assurance engagement on the integrated non-financial group \\nstatement in the summarized management report. With regard to the nature, scope and results of this assurance engagement, \\nwe refer to our assurance opinion dated March 8, 2021. \\nResponsibilities of Management and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements and the Summarized Management Report \\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with \\nIFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and \\nthat the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, \\nliabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such inter nal \\ncontrol as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to con tinue as a \\ngoing concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they \\nare responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the \\nGroup or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. \\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the summarized management report that, as a whole, provides an \\nappropriate view of the Group\\'s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, \\ncomplies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In \\naddition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to \\nenable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be \\nable to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the summarized management report. \\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group\\'s financial reporting process for the preparation of the \\nconsolidated financial statements and of the summarized management report.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n2 \\n–\\n \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\n  \\nConfirmations\\n  \\n\\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\\n \\n\\n207\\n \\nAuditor\\'s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the \\nSummarized Management Report \\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free fro m \\nmaterial misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the summarized management report as a whole provides an \\nappropriate view of the Group\\'s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and \\nthe knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities \\nand risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor\\'s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial \\nstatements and on the summarized management report. \\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section \\n317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement \\nAudits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can \\narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this summarized \\nmanagement report. \\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n–Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the\\nsummarized management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to\\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk\\nof not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may\\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\\n–Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of\\narrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the summarized management report in order to\\ndesign audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion\\non the effectiveness of these systems.\\n–Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates\\nmade by management and related disclosures.\\n–Conclude on the appropriateness of management\\'s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the\\naudit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast\\nsignificant doubt on the Group\\'s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty\\nexists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor\\'s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial\\nstatements and in the summarized management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our\\nrespective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\\'s report.\\nHowever, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\\n–Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the\\ndisclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a\\nmanner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position\\nand financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional\\nrequirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\\n–Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities\\nwithin the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the summarized management\\nreport. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely\\nresponsible for our opinions.\\n–Evaluate the consistency of the summarized management report with the consolidated financial statements, its\\nconformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group\\'s position it provides.\\n–Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the summarized\\nmanagement report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant\\nassumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of\\nthe prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective\\ninformation and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will\\ndiffer materially from the prospective information.

Accordingly, we have to plan and perform the assurance engagement in such a way that we \\nobtain limited assurance as to whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the integrated non-\\nfinancial group statement of the Company for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2020 has not been prepared, in all \\nmaterial respects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.

The company is governed by its Articles of \\nAssociation and the general provisions of German corporate law, particularly the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the \\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB).  \\nA KGaA is a hybrid legal form under German corporate law, which has elements of both a limited partnership and a stock \\ncorporation (Aktiengesellschaft – AG). Like a stock corporation, the share capital of a KGaA is held by its shareholders. Like a \\nlimited partnership, the KGaA is managed by a general partner which is subject to unlimited liability vis-à-vis third parties.  \\nDWS KGaA’s sole general partner, DWS Management GmbH (General Partner), is a wholly -owned subsidiary of DB \\nBeteiligungs-Holding GmbH, which is 100% owned by Deutsche Bank AG.  \\nDWS KGaA’s corporate bodies are its General Partner, acting through its Managing Directors (Geschäftsführer) who collectively  \\nare referred to as the Executive Board of DWS KGaA, its Supervisory Board,  and the General Meeting of DWS KGaA’s \\nshareholders. In addition, DWS KGaA has a Joint Committee that consists of members of the Supervisory Board as well as \\ndelegates appointed by the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner.    DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate Governance Statement \\n Corporate Bodies\\n  \\n\\nOverview of the Corporate Bodies of DWS\\n  \\n\\n214\\n \\nThe Corporate Bodies of DWS are illustrated as follows: \\n\\n1 Right of outside shareholders to appoint supervisory board members does not extend to employee representatives. \\n\\nGeneral Partner \\nThe General Partner has the sole responsibility for the management of DWS KGaA, including all management measures. The \\nGeneral Partner is acting through its Managing Directors (Geschäftsführer), who collectively are referred to as the Executive \\nBoard of DWS KGaA. The Executive Board manages the day-to -day business and represents DWS KGaA vis-à-vis third parties. \\nAny reference to Executive Board in this report refers to the collective Managing Directors of the General Partner.  \\nThe Managing Directors of the General Partner are appointed and dismissed by resolution of the shareholders’ meeting of the \\nGeneral Partner, which also has the authority to appoint one of them as the chairman, i.e. the CEO.   \\nCertain measures by the General Partner, acting through the Executive Board, require approval from the shareholders’ meeting \\nof the General Partner (e.g. the preparation of the annual financial plan of DWS Group, group reorganizations and related \\ncontracts, joint ventures, the acquisition and disposal of participations if the transaction value exceeds a certain threshold).  \\nIn addition, certain measures undertaken by the General Partner in the course of its management of DWS KGaA require the prior \\napproval of the Joint Committee.  \\nSupervisory Board \\nThe Supervisory Board advises and monitors the General Partner, acting through the Executive Board, in its management of the \\ncompany. Except for the employee representatives, the members of the Supervisory Board are elected by the shareholders of \\nDWS KGaA at the General Meeting. Shares held by the General Partner or its affiliated companies are not entitled to vote for the \\nelection or removal of the members of the Supervisory Board.  \\n\\n DB \\nBeteiligungs\\n-\\nHolding \\n\\nGmbH \\n(shareholder of the  \\nGeneral Partner)\\n Outside shareholders\\n\\nDWS Management GmbH \\n(General Partner)\\n DWS Group GmbH & Co. \\nKGaA \\nGeneral Meeting\\nJoint Committee\\n Supervisory Board of \\nDWS Group GmbH & Co. \\nKGaA\\n20.51% \\nof \\nshares\\n79.49% \\nof \\nshares\\n\\n100% \\nof \\nshares\\n\\nAppointment\\n \\n\\n\\nAppointment\\n1\\n\\n\\nApproval of \\ncertain            \\nmanagement \\nmeasures  \\n\\n Monitoring\\n \\n\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nAppointment\\n  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate Governance Statement \\n Corporate Bodies\\n  \\n\\nManaging Directors of the General Partner (Executive \\n\\nBoard)\\n \\n\\n215\\n \\nIn general, the authority and scope for influence of the Supervisory Board of a KGaA is limited as compared to a Supervisory \\nBoard of a stock corporation. In particular, the Supervisory Board is not entitled to appoint and dismiss the Managing Directors of \\nthe general partner. Additionally, the Supervisory Board does not determine the remuneration for the Managing Directors of the \\ngeneral partner and the underlying remuneration system. Further, the Supervisory Board may not subject the management \\nmeasures of the general partner to its consent, or issue rules of procedure for the general partner. \\nJoint Committee \\nBesides the Supervisory Board and the General Partner (acting through the Executive Board), DWS KGaA has established a \\nJoint Committee as an additional corporate body. The Joint Committee consists of two memb ers delegated by the shareholders’ \\nmeeting of the General Partner and two members delegated by the shareholders’ representatives on the Supervisory Board. The \\nshareholders’ meeting of the General Partner appoints one of its delegates as the Chairman of the  Joint Committee; the \\nChairman has a casting vote with regard to decisions taken by the Joint Committee.  \\nThe Joint Committee has approval rights with regard to certain measures undertaken by the General Partner (e.g. group \\nreorganizations and related contracts; the acquisition and disposal of real estate or participations if the transaction value exceeds \\na certain threshold). The Joint Committee also possesses a right of proposal with respect to the ratification of acts of \\nmanagement of the General Partner and with respect to the determination of the variable compensation of the Managing \\nDirectors of the General Partner. Nonetheless, these matters are legally subject to decisions of the shareholders’ meeting of  the \\nGeneral Partner. Therefore, the proposals of the Joint Committee are not legally binding and the shareholders’ meeting of the \\nGeneral Partner remains independent in its right to decide on these matters. The Joint Committee reports in text form to the \\nGeneral Meeting on its activities. The report for the reporting year can be found under ‘Report of the Joint Committee’.  \\nGeneral Meeting \\nThe General Meeting is the resolution body of the shareholders of DWS KGaA. Shareholders can exercise their voting rights at \\nthe General Meeting themselves, by proxy via a representative of their choice, or by a company-nominated proxy acting on their \\ninstructions. Among other matters, the General Meeting approves the annual financial statements of the company. The internal \\nprocedure of the General Meeting of a KGaA corresponds to that of the general meeting of a stock corporation.  \\nCertain material matters requiring a resolution of the General Meeting also require the consent of the General Partner (which \\ndoes not have a voting right in the General Meeting as it does not hold shares in DWS KGaA), such as amendments to the \\nArticles of Association, dissolution of the company, mergers, a change in the legal form of DWS KGaA, enterprise agreements \\n(Unternehmensverträge, such as domination agreements or profit and loss transfer agreements) and other fundamental changes \\nas well as the approval of the annual financial statements. The General Partner therefore has a de facto veto right on these \\nmatters.  \\nThe members of the Supervisory Board – with the exception of the employee representatives  – are elected by the General \\nMeeting. \\nManaging Directors of the General Partner (Executive Board) \\nThe General Partner fulfils its task of managing DWS KGaA through its Managing Directors (Geschäftsführer), who are \\ncollectively referred to as the Executive Board. The Managing Directors are appointed and dismissed by resolution of the \\nshareholders’ meeting of the General Partner. Pursuant to the Articles of Association of the General Partner, the General Par tner \\nshall have at least two Managing Directors.

The Supervisory Board meets regularly \\nwithout the Executive Board. \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 the Supervisory Board performed a review of the efficiency of its activities. It conducted a \\nquestionnaire-based self-assessment, which was complemented by interviews with selected Supervisory Board members, \\nincluding the Chairman and the two new Supervisory Board members who were appointed after the last self-assessment in 2019. \\nThe review process was supported by an external advisor who designed the questionnaire and conducted the interviews, using a \\npreviously agreed interview guide.

DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate Governance Statement \\n Corporate Bodies\\n  \\n\\nSupervisory Board of DWS\\n  \\n\\n221\\n \\nObjectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board, profile of requirements and \\nstatus of implementation \\nObjectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board \\nIn accordance with German law, the members of the Supervisory Board must be reliable, must have the expertise required to \\nperform their control function and to assess and monitor the businesses the company operates, and must commit sufficient time \\nto the performance of their tasks. The Supervisory Board established objectives for its composition and adopted a profile of \\nrequirements for the Supervisory Board collectively as described below in its meeting on January 29, 2019. At its meeting on \\nDecember 11, 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to determine that a min imum of 5 shareholders’ representatives shall be \\nindependent from the company and its Executive Board, and a minimum of 5 shareholders’ representatives shall be independent \\nfrom the controlling shareholder. \\nThe Supervisory Board shall be composed in such a way that its members as a whole possess the knowledge, abilities and \\nexpert experience to properly complete its tasks. The members of the Supervisory Board collectively and the members of its Audit \\nand Risk Committee must be familiar with the financial industry in general and more specifically with the asset management \\nindustry. The composition of the Supervisory Board shall ensure the Board’s qualified control of and advice to the Executive \\nBoard taking into account that DWS Group is an internationally operating, broadly positioned asset manager. The members of the \\nSupervisory Board should preserve the public reputation of DWS Group and, in particular, attention should be placed on the \\nintegrity, personality, willingness to perform, professionalism and independence of the individuals proposed for election. The \\nobjective is for the Supervisory Board collectively to have all of the knowledge and experience considered to be essential, w hile \\ntaking into account the business activities of DWS Group. The current members of the Supervisory Board fulfil these objectives. \\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board shall have what it considers to be an adequate number of independent members from the \\ngroup of shareholders’ representatives, thereby taking into account the share holder structure. A Supervisory Board member is \\nconsidered independent if he or she is independent from the company, its Executive Board and from the controlling shareholder. \\nThe Supervisory Board has determined that at least five of the shareholders’ representatives shall be independent.  Currently, the \\nSupervisory Board has six independent shareholders’ representatives: Ms Annabelle Bexiga, Mr  Aldo Cardoso, Mr Minoru \\nKimura, Mr Richard I. Morris, Jr., Ms Margret Suckale and Ms Ute Wolf. \\nMr von Rohr and Mr Leukert are members of the management board of Deutsche Bank AG. Deutsche Bank AG is the sole \\nshareholder of DB Beteiligungs-Holding GmbH, which is of the majority shareholder of DWS KGaA. They are, therefore, not \\nconsidered independent from the controlling shareholder and thus not as independent as defined in Section C.6 of the German \\nCorporate Governance Code. However, they are considered independent from the company and the Executive Board as they \\nhave no personal or business relationship with the company or its Executive Board that may cause a substantial structural and \\nnot merely temporary – conflict of interest. They are therefore considered independent for the purposes of Section C.7 of the \\nGerman Corporate Governance Code. The members of the Supervisory Board may not exercise functions on a management \\nbody of or perform advisory duties at major competitors. Important and not just temporary conflicts of interest with respect to a \\nmember of the Supervisory Board shall lead to a termination of the mandate. As described in the Report of the Supervisory \\nBoard, none of the Supervisory Board members had any conflicts of interests in the reporting year. \\nThere is a regular maximum age limit of 75. In exceptional cases, a Supervisory Board member can be elected or appointed for a \\nperiod that extends no longer than until the end of the fourth Ordinary General Meeting that takes place after he/she has tur ned \\nthe age of 75. The regular length of each individual Supervisory Board membership is not to exceed 15 years. The age limit and \\nthe limit on the length of Supervisory Board membership are met by all current Supervisory Board members. \\nThe Supervisory Board shall not comprise more than two former Managing Directors of the General Partner. Currently, there is no \\nformer Managing Director of the General Partner on the Supervisory Board. \\nThe Supervisory Board respects diversity when proposing members for appointment to the Supervisory Board. In light of the \\ninternational operations of DWS Group, care should be taken that the Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of members \\nwith long-term international experience. As per today, the professional careers or private lives of four members of the Supervisory \\nBoard are centred outside Germany. Furthermore, all of the shareholders’ representatives on the Supervisory Board have severa l \\nyears of international experience from their current or former activities as management board members or a comparable \\nexecutive function of corporations or organizations with international operations. In these two ways, the Supervisory Board \\nbelieves the international activities of DWS are sufficiently taken into account. The objective is to retain the currently existing \\ninternational profile. \\nFor the election proposals of shareholders’ representatives to the General Meeting of DWS KGaA, the Supervisory Board takes \\ninto account the recommendations of the Nomination Committee. In reviewing potential candidates for a new election or \\nsubsequent appointments to Supervisory Board positions, qualified women shall be included in the selection process and shall be  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate Governance Statement \\n Corporate Bodies\\n  \\n\\nSupervisory Board of\\n  \\nDWS\\n \\n\\n222\\n \\nappropriately considered in the election proposals. In accordance with Section 111 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act, the \\nSupervisory Board determined a target for the percentage of female members on the Supervisory Board of at least 30% of the \\nmembers by January 29, 2024. Currently, four Supervisory Board members are women. This reflects a share of around 33. 34% \\nof all members and more than 30% of the shareholders’ representatives.  It should be taken into account that the Supervisory \\nBoard can only influence the composition of the Supervisory Board through its election proposals to the General Meeting. \\nThe Supervisory Board profile of requirements includes, in particular, the knowledge, skills and professional expertise that are \\ncollectively required to perform the tasks of the Supervisory Board of DWS, taking into account the suitability and propernes s \\nrequirements of the European Banking Authority and the standards which are required under applicable laws (collective \\nqualifications). The Supervisory Board as a whole shall have an understanding of the fields of expertise specified below that is \\nappropriate for the size and complexity of DWS. This does not mean that each Supervisory Board member must have expertise \\nin each of the fields listed below. Rather, the expertise contributed individually by each of the Supervisory Board members \\ncombined shall ensure that all fields of expertise are covered by the Supervisory Board as a whole. \\nThe fields of expertise include, in particular: \\n−Supervisory Experience: Preferably, experience as a member in a supervisory capacity on dual-tiered board structures, and as\\nsuch, performing a monitoring role over the management body.\\n−Asset Management: Clear understanding of fiduciary responsibilities, fund management and prudent investment processes of\\na bank-owned asset manager.\\n−Experience with client handling, financial markets and jurisdictional expertise with due consideration to be given to US\\nrepresentation.\\n−Technology, digitalisation, artificial intelligence and operational excellence.\\n−Financial expertise: At least one member of the Supervisory Board must have experience in the field of accounting or audit\\npursuant to Section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). It would be advantageous to have that experience\\ngained within asset management with some knowledge of credit and liquidity management. At least one independent member,\\nwho can serve as the chairperson of the audit and risk committee, shall have specific knowledge and experience in applying\\naccounting principles and internal control procedures.\\n−Risk management and controls which includes promoting a culture of individual accountability, knowledge and experience of\\nrisk governance and applicable control environment.\\n−Compensation and compensation systems as well as succession management.\\n−Corporate and social responsibility, including reporting.\\n−Strategic planning, business and risk strategies as well as their implementation.\\n−Governance and corporate culture.\\n−ESG and Sustainability: Expert knowledge of ESG standards and best practices and their implementation.\\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board should be able to weigh the short- and long-term benefits and risks of \\nfinancial decisions (business judgement). He or she should act in accordance with stated values and principles and should \\nencourage an environment of openness and challenge. Each member of the Supervisory Board should be able to build \\nproductive partnerships with key constituents including fellow Supervisory and Executive Board members. Furthermore, each \\nmember of the Supervisory Board should be free from structural conflict of interests and should not engage in any business \\nactivities that conflict, directly or indirectly, with regulated activities of DWS. The members of the Supervisory Board shall also \\nhave sufficient time to carry out their respective responsibilities taking into account all personal and professional commitments. \\nMembers of the Supervisory Board may not hold more than the allowed number of Supervisory Board mandates in accordance \\nwith the applicable legal requirements.

The committees work closely together and, to \\nthe extent required, coordinate their activities with each other and with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and consult each \\nother on an ad-hoc basis. To increase efficiency and enhance the exchange of information, committees can also hold joint \\nmeetings.  \\nThe committee chairpersons report regularly to the Supervisory Board on the work of the committees. The Report of the \\nSupervisory Board in the Annual Report 2020 provides information on the work of the committees over the reporting year. \\nAudit and Risk Committee \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee consists of three members of the Supervisory Board representing shareholders and one member \\nof the Supervisory Board representing employees. The committee is chaired by a representative of the shareholders. The \\nChairperson of the committee is elected by the Supervisory Board. \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee generally supports the Supervisory Board in its monitoring activities, in particular, in monitoring the \\neffectiveness of the risk management system, the auditing of the financial statements, especially with regard to the auditor’ s \\nindependence and the additional services provided by the auditor a s well as the Executive Board’s prompt remediation –  through \\nsuitable measures – of any deficiencies that might be identified by the auditor and internal control functions based on internal and \\nexternal audits, in particular any such deficiencies that might relate to any weaknesses that might be found in risk controls, non-\\ncompliance with policies, laws and regulatory requirements.  \\nThe committee is entitled to inspect all business documentation of DWS KGaA. The committee is also entitled to obtain, through \\nits Chairperson, information in connection with its tasks from the auditor, the Executive Board, the Head of Group Audit and  – with \\nthe prior consent of the Executive Board – senior managers reporting directly to the Executive Board.  \\nThe committee pre-reviews the annual and consolidated financial statements and management reports including the integrated \\nnon-financial group statement, as they are prepared. The committee discusses the audit reports with the auditor. The committee \\nalso prepares the decisions of the Supervisory Board on the proposal for a resolution to be submitted to the General Meeting with \\nregard to the establishment of the annual financial statements and the approval of the consolidated financial statements as w ell \\nas the resolution proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit and submits corresponding recommendations to the Supervi-\\nsory Board. It discusses important changes to the audit and accounting methods. \\nThe committee discusses the half-year financial reports and the report on the limited review of the quarterly financial statements \\nwith the Executive Board and the auditor. The committee also supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the financial \\nreporting process and can submit recommendations or suggestions to the Supervisory Board on ensuring the integrity of the \\nfinancial reporting process.  \\nThe committee submits proposals to the Supervisory Board for the appointment of the auditor, which shall include at least two \\ncandidates when tendering the auditor mandate and complies with the requirements of Article 16 (2) Regulation (EU) No. \\n537/2014 to the extent applicable and it prepares the proposal of the Supervisory Board to the General Meeting for the election of \\nthe auditor. The committee advises the Supervisory Board on issuing, terminating and continuing the audit mandate to the auditor \\nand submits proposals to the Supervisory Board for t he auditor’s remuneration. The committee supports the Supervisory Board in \\nmonitoring the independence, quality, qualification and efficiency of the auditor as well as the rotation of the members of the audit \\nteam. Mandates for non-audit-related services given to the auditor or to companies to which the auditor is related in legal, \\neconomic or personnel terms need the prior consent of the Audit and Risk Committee. \\nThe committee is appointed by the Supervisory Board to resolve on reserved matters in relation to material Related Party \\nTransactions pursuant to section 111b of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). In this context, the Audit and Risk Committee \\nis supported by the Related Party Transaction Council, which issues the Related Party Approval Report to the committee if \\nrequired. The committee arranges to be informed regularly about the work performed by Internal Audit, the effectiveness of the \\ninternal audit system and in particular about the focal areas of its auditing activity and on the results of its audits. It is responsible, \\nin particular, for receiving and handling the quarterly, annual and ad-hoc reports provided by Internal Audit. The Executive Board \\ninforms the committee about special audits, substantial complaints and other exceptional measures at DWS KGaA and its \\nsubsidiaries on the part of German and foreign regulatory authorities.

In particular complaints concerning accounting, internal accounting controls , \\nauditing and other financial reporting matters must be submitted to the committee without undue delay. \\nReports concerning compliance matters are presented in the meetings of the committee on a regular basis. The committee \\nChairperson is entitled, in addition to the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, to obtain information directly from the Head of \\nCompliance. The committee is responsible for taking receipt of and handling the report by the Head of Compliance on the \\nappropriateness and effectiveness of the principles, methods and procedures in accordance with Article 22 (2) lit. c) of Delegated \\nRegulation (EU) No. 2017/565 (Compliance Report). The Compliance Report is issued at least once a year, i.e. within a 12 \\nmonths period. \\nThe committee advises the Supervisory Board in addition on the overall risk appetite and risk strategy on a consolidated basis, \\nand monitors the implementation of the stated risk appetite and risk strategy on a consolidated basis by senior management. T he \\ncommittee monitors material aspects of the rating and valuation processes. The committee receives reports from the Executive \\nBoard, which are appropriate to monitor whether the conditions in the client business are in line with the business model and risk \\nstructure of DWS KGaA. If this is not the case, the committee requests proposals from the Executive Board on how the conditions \\nin the client business could be structured to align them with the business model and risk structure of DWS KGaA. The committe e \\nalso monitors the implementation of such proposals. In addition the committee reviews whether the incentives set by the \\ncompensation system take into account the risk, capital and liquidity structure of DWS KGaA as well as the likelihood and \\nmaturity of earnings. This is without prejudice to the tasks of the Remuneration Committee. The committee determines the nature, \\nscope, format and frequency of the information which the General Partner is required to submit on strategy and risks. \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee held eight meetings in 2020. \\nThe current members of the Audit and Risk Committee are Ms Ute Wolf (Chairperson), Mr Stephan Accorsini, Mr Aldo Cardoso, \\nand Mr Richard I. Morris, Jr.  \\nNomination Committee \\nThe Nomination Committee consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board as well as two further members of the Supervisory \\nBoard representing shareholders and one member of the Supervisory Board representing employees. \\nThe composition of the Nomination Committee follows Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG), which stipulates that \\nthe Nomination Committee shall take on additional tasks that shall not be performed solely by the shareholders’ representatives \\non the Supervisory Board. However, it is ensured that the candidate recommendations for the election proposals to the general \\nmeeting are prepared exclusively by the committee’s shareholder representatives. The committee is chaired by a member of the \\nSupervisory Board representing shareholders.  \\nThe shareholders’ representatives on the Nomination Committee prepare the Supervisory Board’s proposals for the  election or \\nappointment of new shareholders’ representatives to the Supervisory Board. In this context, they take into account the statut ory \\nrequirements, guidelines from supervisory authorities and criteria specified by the Supervisory Board for its composition as well \\nas the balance and diversity of the knowledge, skills and experience of all members of the Supervisory Board, prepare a job d e-\\nscription with a candidate profile, and state the time commitment associated with the tasks. \\nThe committee is responsible for drawing up an objective to promote the representation of the under-represented gender on the \\nSupervisory Board as well as a strategy for achieving this and the regular assessment of the structure, size, composition and per-\\nformance of the Supervisory Board and making recommendations to the Supervisory Board regarding this. The Nomination Com-\\nmittee supports the Supervisory Board in the regular assessment of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board as well as of the body collectively, and in reviewing the principles of the Executive Board for \\nselecting and appointing persons to the upper management levels and the recommendations made to the Executive Board in this \\nrespect. \\nThe Nomination Committee held one meeting in 2020. \\nThe current members of the Nomination Committee are Mr Karl von Rohr (Chairperson),  Mr Richard I.

The effects of the compensation systems on risk, \\ncapital and liquidity management shall be assessed and it shall be ensured that the compensation systems and the group-wide \\ncompensation strategy – in consideration of the corporate culture – are aligned to achieving the objectives set out in the business \\nand risk strategies of DWS Group. \\nIn addition, the committee supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the process to identify Group Risk Takers in accordance \\nwith Section 27 (2) sentence 1 of the Regulation on Remuneration in Financial Institutions (InstVV) and in this context checks the \\nappropriate structure of the compensation systems for the relevant employees.  \\nThe committee supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring whether the internal controls and other relevant areas are properl y \\nimplemented in the structuring of the compensation systems. It also supports the Supervisory Board in producing the proposals \\nfor resolutions on the structuring of variable and fixed compensation in accordance with Section 25a (5) sentence 6 of the Ger-\\nman Banking Act (KWG) and for the approval of the remuneration system pursuant to Section 120a (1) of the German Stock Cor-\\nporation Act (AktG). \\nThe committee coordinates its work with the Audit and Risk Committee and works closely with it as required in order to properly \\nperform its tasks. \\nThe committee is authorized to obtain, via its Chairperson, information relating to the committee tasks from the head of the inter-\\nnal audit department and from the heads of the organizational units responsible for structuring the compensation systems. The \\nExecutive Board must be informed of this. In addition, the Committee Chairperson is kept up-to -date by the Compensation Officer \\non his work and ensures close coordination of the monitoring activities as well as the submission of the Compensation Officer ’s \\ninformative reports on the appropriateness and structure of the compensation system. \\nThe Remuneration Committee held two meetings in 2020. \\nThe current members of the Remuneration Committee are Ms Margret Suckale (Chairperson), Ms Annabelle Bexiga, Mr Aldo \\nCardoso and Mr Erwin Stengele.

KGaA submit the following declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the German \\nStock Corporation Act (AktG):  \\nThe last Declaration of Conformity was issued on December 12, 2019. Since then and under consideration of the specific \\ncharacteristics of a partnership limited by shares as outlined in Section I below, DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA (DWS KGaA) \\nhas complied with the recommendations of the “Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code” in the \\nversion dated February 7, 2017, as published in the Federal Gazette on April 24, 2017, subject to the deviations as disclosed  in \\nSection II. \\nOn December 16, 2019, the „Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance  Code“ submitted a new version of \\nthe German Corporate Governance Code, which came into effect with its publication by the Federal Ministry of Justice and \\nConsumer Protection in the official section of the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on March 20, 2020. Under consideration of \\nthe specific characteristics of DWS KGaA’s legal form as outlined in Section I below DWS KGaA complies with the applicable \\nrecommendations of this new version and will continue to comply with them in the future, whereas as of now the deviations as \\ndisclosed in Section III apply. \\nSection I: Specific characteristics of the legal form of a partnership limited by shares \\n\\uf02dTaking into account the specific features of the legal form of a partnership limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaft auf\\nAktien or KGaA) several recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) can only be applied in a\\nmodified way. The GCGC is geared towards the governance structure typical for a German stock corporation\\n(Aktiengesellschaft or AG) and does not consider specific characteristics of a KGaA. DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate \\nGovernance Statement\\n  \\nCompliance with the German Corporate Governance \\n Code\\n \\n\\n229\\n \\n\\uf02dIn the legal form of a KGaA, the tasks and duties performed by the management board of an AG are undertaken by the\\ngeneral partners, who are determined in the articles of association of the KGaA and not by the supervisory board. The sole\\ngeneral partner of DWS KGaA is DWS Management GmbH (DWSM GmbH), who has the sole responsibility for the\\nmanagement of DWS KGaA, including all day-to -day management measures and representation of the company vis-à-vis\\nthird parties. The Managing Directors of DWSM GmbH jointly manage the business activities of DWSM GmbH and  – with\\nregard to the position of DWSM GmbH as the General Partner of DWS KGaA  – the business activities of DWS KGaA.\\nThe Supervisory Board of DWS KGaA has no authority to appoint and dismiss the Managing Directors of the General\\nPartner, preside over associated contractual arrangements or determine the remuneration system and the fixed and variable\\ncompensation of the Managing Directors. Such decisions are  taken by the shareholders’ meeting of the General Partner.\\nCertain management measures by the General Partner require prior approval from the shareholders‘ meeting of the General\\nPartner.\\n\\uf02dIn addition to the corporate bodies regulated by German law, the legal form of the KGaA allows for the establishment of\\nadditional governance bodies. DWS KGaA has put this in use and has set up the Joint Committee as an additional corporate\\nbody. Certain management measures require the approval from the Joint Committee as set forth in the Articles of\\nAssociation of DWS KGaA. Accordingly, DWSM GmbH may only take such measures with the consent of the Joint\\nCommittee. The Joint Committee also possesses a right of proposal with respect to the ratification of acts of management of\\nthe Managing Directors of DWSM GmbH and with respect to the determination of their variable compensation. Nonetheless,\\nthese proposals are legally not binding for the shareholders’ meeting of DWSM GmbH. The Joint Committee reports to the\\ngeneral meeting of DWS KGaA on its activities.\\n\\uf02dThe authority and scope for influence of the supervisory board of a KGaA is limited as compared to the supervisory board of\\na stock corporation. In addition to the specifics above, the supervisory board of DWS KGaA as a mere supervisory and\\nadvisory body is not entitled to subject the management measures to its consent, or issue rules of procedure for DWSM\\nGmbH. Such rights are reserved to the shareholders’ meeting of DWSM GmbH which can take these measures for the\\nManaging Directors of DWSM GmbH.\\n\\uf02dThe general meeting of the shareholders of a KGaA has in principle the same rights and responsibilities as the general\\nmeeting of a German stock corporation. In particular this includes the ratification of the acts of management of the general\\npartner and the supervisory board, the election of shareholders’ representatives to the supervisory board, the voting on the\\nappropriation of profits and the appointment of the external financial auditor. As defined by German law, the general meeting\\nof a KGaA also approves the annual financial statements, which in the case of an AG is typically performed by the\\nsupervisory board and only subject to approval of the general meeting in exceptional cases if the management board and\\nsupervisory board decide that the general meeting shall approve, or the supervisory board refuses its approval. Certain\\nmaterial matters requiring a resolution of the general meeting, such as the approval of the annual financial statements but\\nalso measures aiming at structural changes such as mergers, a change in the legal form of the company or the conclusion of\\nenterprise agreements, also require the consent of the general partner.\\nSection II: Deviations – Code in the version dated February 7, 2017: \\n\\uf02dRelating to No. 5.3.3, according to which the supervisory board shall form a nomination committee composed exclusively of\\nshareholder representatives. Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act stipulates that the nomination committee of the\\nsupervisory board must take on additional tasks that should be performed not solely by the shareholder representatives on\\nthe supervisory board. Against this background, the Nomination Committee of the Supervisory Board of DWS KGaA also\\ncomprises employee representatives. However, it will be ensured that the candidate recommendations for the election\\nproposals to the general meeting will be prepared exclusively by the committee’s shareholder representatives.\\n\\uf02dRelating to No. 4.2.3 (2) sentence 6, according to which the amount of compensation for management board members shall\\nbe capped, both overall and with regard to variable compensation components. The existing employment contracts (in\\nconjunction with equity plan conditions) of the members of the Managing Directors of DWSM GmbH do provide for a limit\\n(cap) in the awarding of total compensation and their variable compensation components. In this context, however, some\\nhold the view that such limits would have to apply not only to the granting and awarding of the compensation components but\\nalso to their later payout. Although DWS KGaA does not consider this view to be convincing, we state merely as a\\nprecautionary measure that a limit (cap) has not been set for the payout amount of deferred equity-based compensation and\\nthat therefore DWS KGaA deviates from the recommendation in No. 4.2.3 (2) sentence 6 according to this interpretation.\\nSection III: Deviations – Code in the version dated December 16, 2019: \\n\\uf02dRelating to recommendation C.4 of the Code, whereby a supervisory board member who is not a member of any\\nmanagement board of a listed company shall not accept more than five supervisory board mandates at non-group listed DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate \\nGovernance Statement\\n  \\nCompliance with the German Corporate Governance Code\\n  \\n\\n230\\n \\ncompanies or comparable functions, with an appointment as chair of a supervisory board being counted twice. One member \\nof the Supervisory Board of DWS KGaA, Mr Aldo Cardoso, currently holds five mandates in supervisory bodies of listed \\ncompanies and in one case he chairs the respective board. Whether the number of mandates held by a member of a \\nsupervisory board seems appropriate should in the opinion of DWS KGaA, however, be assessed more appropriately on a \\ncase-by-case basis than with a rigid upper limit. The individual workload expected for a member of a supervisory board as a \\nresult of the total number of mandates held does not necessarily increase in proportion to their number. Moreover, Mr \\nCardoso has declared to the Supervisory Board of DWS KGaA that he has sufficient time to perform the duties associated to \\nhis position as a member of this body with the required due regularity and care. The Supervisory Board has determined that \\nall members have sufficient time to exercise their mandate at DWS KGaA taking into account all personal and professional \\ncommitments. \\n\\uf02dRelating to recommendation D.5 of the Code, according to which the supervisory board shall form a nomination committee\\ncomposed exclusively of shareholder representatives. Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act stipulates that the\\nnomination committee of the supervisory board must take on additional tasks that should be performed not solely by the\\nshareholder representatives on the supervisory board. Against this background, the Nomination Committee of the\\nSupervisory Board of DWS KGaA also comprises employee representatives. However, it will be ensured that the candidate\\nrecommendations for the election proposals to the general meeting will be prepared exclusively by the committee’s\\nshareholder representatives.\\n\\uf02dRelating to recommendation G.1, first bullet, which recommends that the remuneration system for the management board\\nshall – inter alia – define how the target total remuneration is determined for each management board member, and the\\namount that the total remuneration must not exceed (maximum remuneration). The remuneration system defines a maximum\\nremuneration, but this maximum remuneration currently does not include the service cost for the contributions to the\\ncompany pension of the Managing Directors of DWSM GmbH. For the future, it is envisaged to comply with the\\nrecommendation also in this regard.\\n\\uf02dRelating to recommendation G.10, sentence 2, whereby granted long-term variable remuneration components shall be\\naccessible to management board members only after a period of four years. In accordance with the Remuneration\\nRegulation for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung), the granted long-term variable amounts vest in annual tranches\\nover a retention period of five years. If the tranches represent share-based remuneration elements, they are subject to an\\nadditional holding period of one year after they become due. The Managing Directors of DWSM GmbH can thus dispose of\\nan initial small partial amount of the long-term grant amounts after one year and, taking into account the retention period and\\nthe holding period after six years, the last partial amount.\\nFrankfurt am Main, in December 2020 \\nThe Managing Directors     The Supervisory Board  \\nof DWS Management GmbH  of DWS Group GmbH & Co.

On \\nJanuary 29, 2019, the Supervisory Board set a target for the percentage of women on our Supervisory Board of at least 30% of \\nthe members by January 29, 2024.   \\nOur Executive Board includes one woman as of the date of this Corporate Governance Statement. A target for the percentage of \\nwomen on the Executive Board of our General Partner is legally not required and has not been set so far. \\nOn January 31, 2019, the Executive Board set targets for the percentage of women at 26% for the first management level and \\n29% for the second management level, to be reached December 31, 2021. When the decision was made, the percentage of \\nwomen at the first management level was 23% and 26% at the second management level.  \\nThe population of the first management level comprises of senior managers who report directly to the Executive Board and \\nmanagers with comparable responsibilities.

As diversity and inclusion are central to the firm’s culture, our continuous f ocus is to: \\n−build talented and diverse teams to drive business results\\n−create a respectful and inclusive environment where people can thrive\\n−strengthen our relationship with clients, partners, regulators, communities, and potential employees.\\nWe aim to attract, develop, and retain the best people from all cultures, countries, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, \\nabilities, beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. To this end, and to prepare for opportunities and challenges arising from  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate \\nGovernance Statement\\n  \\nTargets for the Proportion of Women in Management \\n\\nPositions / Gender Quota\\n  \\n \\n\\n232\\n \\nchanging demographics, digitalization, and the future of work, we follow an integrated and multi-dimensional approach to diversity \\nand inclusion. We also aim at giving equal opportunities to employees who work both full-time and part time. This year the \\npercentage of employees globally who work part time stood at 8.8% (2019: 11.8%). \\nWe are convinced that diversity and inclusion, for example, stimulate innovation and help to make more balanced decisions, an d \\nthus play a decisive role in the success of the DWS Group.  \\nThe Supervisory Board and Executive Board want to and should also serve as a role model for the DWS Group with regard to \\ndiversity and inclusion. In line with our above mentioned conviction, a diverse composition of the committees also helps the \\nSupervisory Board and the Executive Board to be able to properly perform the tasks and duties incumbent upon them under the \\nlaw, the Articles of Association and the rules of procedure. \\nDiversity Concept for the Supervisory Board \\nThe Supervisory Board is to be composed in such a way that its members, as a whole, possess the expertise, skills and \\nprofessional experience required to effectively monitor and advise the Executive Board in its management and observance of th e \\nrelevant supervisory regulations. \\nIn light of the international operations of DWS, care shall be taken, in particular, that the Supervisory Board has an appropriate \\nnumber of members with many years of international experience. \\nAlso in light of the legal requirements to be observed, the Supervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30% women (by \\nJanuary 29, 2024). \\nThere is an age limit of 75, in principle, for members of the Supervisory Board and the maximum length of each individual \\nSupervisory Board membership shall generally not exceed 15 years. \\nImplementation \\nIt should be taken into account that the Supervisory Board can only influence the composition of the Supervisory Board throug h \\nits proposals to the General Meeting for the election of the shareholder representatives. \\nBased on a proposal of the Nomination Committee, a profile of requirements was issued for the Supervisory Board. The profiles \\nsummarize the knowledge, abilities and experience required to properly complete the tasks of the Supervisory Board (collectiv e \\nsuitability). \\nFor the election proposals to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board takes into account the objective to which the \\nSupervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30% women (by January  29, 2024). \\nResults achieved in the 2020 financial year \\nAt the end of the financial year, eight men and four women (33.34%) were members of the Supervisory Board. \\nThe age structure is diverse, ranging from 51 to 71 years of age at the end of the financial year.  \\nAt the end of the financial year, the length of experience as member of the Supervisory Board of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, \\nwhich was constituted first in 2018, ranged from under one year to around 3 years. Two of the 12 members joined the \\nSupervisory Board in the 2020 financial year. The length of experience in comparable governance bodies was between three and \\nseventeen years. \\nIn accordance with our objectives specified above, all of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have sever al \\nyears of international experience from their current or former activities as management board members or a comparable \\nexecutive function of corporations or organizations with international operations.  \\nThe diverse range of the members’ educational and professional backgrounds includes banking, business administration, \\nscience, law, and information technology. \\nDWS transparently reports on Supervisory Board diversity, in addition to the information presented above, in this Corporate \\nGovernance Statement in the section ‘Corporate Bodies  - Supervisory Board of DWS’.  DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\n3 \\n–\\n \\nCorporate \\nGovernance Statement\\n  \\nTargets for the Proportion of Women in Management \\n\\nPositions / Gender Quota\\n  \\n \\n\\n233\\n \\nDiversity Concept for the Executive Board \\nThrough the composition of the Executive Board, it is to be ensured that its members have, at all times, the required knowledge, \\nskills and experience necessary to properly perform their tasks. Accordingly, when selecting members for the Executive Board, \\ncare is to be taken that they collectively have sufficient expertise and diversity within the meaning of our objectives specified \\nabove. \\nAs a rule, a member of the Executive Board should not have exceeded the age limit of 67 years, applicable in Germany, for the \\nregular retirement pension on the expiry date of their appointment. \\nImplementation \\nThe implementation of the Diversity Concept takes places in the course of selecting new members for the Executive Board of \\nDWS Management GmbH which are appointed by the sole shareholder.  \\nAs part of the succession management, a series of sophisticated leadership and board readiness assessments to identify and \\ndevelop management talent for enhanced leadership responsibilities have been implemented. The discipline applied to \\nsuccession management in line with best practices has resulted in long-term succession plans. \\nResults achieved in the 2020 financial year \\nAt the end of the financial year, the Executive Board was composed of five men and one woman. \\nThe age structure is diverse, ranging from 39 to 65 years of age at the end of the financial year. \\nThe length of experience as member of the Executive Board of DWS, which was first established in March 2018 ranged from less \\nthan one to below three years. The length of experience in comparable management bodies ranged between three and around \\neleven years.  \\nAlso with our strategy in mind of being a leading Asset Manager with headquarter in Germany and operating globally, four of the \\nsix Executive Board members, as of the end of the financial year, have a German background. Other members come from \\nAustralia and England. \\nHowever, the ethnic diversity of the Executive Board does not currently reflect the full diversity of the markets where we do \\nbusiness or the diversity of our employees. \\nThe diverse range of the members’ educational and professional backgrounds includes banking, business administration, social \\nsciences.  \\nDWS transparently reports on Executive Board diversity, in addition to the information presented above, in this Corporate \\nGovernance Statement in the section ‘Corporate Bodies –  Managing Directors of the General Partner (Executive Board)’.

At the second level below the Executive Board, this percentage stood at 28.2% (2019: \\n26.8%).

To ensure ongoing employee \\nawareness of the conduct and ethics expected, the course content of various mandatory training modules are based on the \\nCode’s principles and/or consistently includ e references to the Code. The mandatory Regulatory Training curriculum applies to all \\nemployees of DWS. \\nGiven the vast majority of staff (93%) completed the Code of Conduct training in 2018 & 2019, in 2020 the focus was on other \\nCompliance training modules. For example, below is the 83% of DWS staff who in 2020 completed the course ‘Compliance –  the \\nEssentials of Managing our Conflicts of Interest’. Many staff who have not yet completed this course have completed other \\nmandatory training modules as part of the Regulatory Training Curriculum. \\n\\n2020\\n \\n2019\\n \\n\\nPercentage of employees who have completed training on compliance and ethics at 31 Dec 2020\\n \\n83%\\n \\n93%\\n \\nEmpowering and Effective Managers  \\n-2020 score\\nFavourable score +7% versus 2019\\n   DWS \\n \\n\\nAnnual Report \\n 2020\\n \\nDWS Human Capital\\n  \\n\\n250\\n \\nEmployee Incident Management \\nGrievances \\nDWS strives for high standards of workplace conduct and management of employment processes in relation to the hiring, \\nmanagement and organization of our employees.  \\nDWS maintains clear and consistent processes in relation to handling employee complaints, including regular review of grievance \\ncases at senior management levels to ensure we uphold our values and provide a diverse, inclusive and productive working \\nenvironment. We do not regard employee complaints as a zero sum game, indeed we actively encourage  a ‘speak up culture’, \\nand to that extent we accept that the number of grievance cases may fluctuate over time, although we use our best endeavours \\nto create an optimal working environment for all employees.  \\nThe numbers below reflect formal complaints filed and not necessarily whether the complaint was upheld, partially or otherwise. \\n\\nGrievance cases \\n–\\n \\nformally recorded employee complaints\\n \\n 2020\\n \\n2019\\n \\n\\nWorkplace conduct\\n \\n 4\\n \\n3\\n \\n\\nEmployment Processes\\n \\n 1\\n \\n3\\n \\n\\nOther\\n \\n −\\n \\n3\\n \\n\\nTotal\\n \\n 5\\n \\n9\\n \\n\\nNB. Grievance case data for Germany is not included due to local arrangements and data protection requirements. \\nDisciplinary Actions \\nDWS maintains clear and consistent processes to manage situations where employee conduct may not meet the high standards \\nexpected of the organization. There are a range of internally governed disciplinary actions DWS may take depending on the \\ncircumstances and local country regulations. The type of actions may include formal verbal warnings, written or final written \\nwarnings or more serious outcomes that may include compensation impacts and/or termination.   \\nThe numbers below reflect those cases considered internally by DWS to warrant a formal disciplinary action in accordance with \\ninternally validated governance standards. As can be seen by calculating the % of cases to total employee numbers, the overall \\nnumber of cases is very low, well less than 1%, highlighting our strong culture of integrity and ethical standards. \\n\\nInternal Disciplinary Actions\\n \\n 2020\\n \\n2019\\n \\n\\nNumber\\n \\n 10\\n \\n18\\n \\n\\nAs a % of \\ntotal employees\\n \\n 0.25\\n%\\n \\n0.50\\n%\\n \\n\\nNote: One additional case is pending outcome and may or may not result in a disciplinary action \\nSafety Incidents: Disclaimer \\nPlease note: International standards for Human resource management recommend disclosing metrics reflecting lost time injuries , \\nnumber of occupational accidents and number of people killed during work.

Forward-looking \\nstatements are statements that are not \\nhistorical facts; they include statements \\nabout our beliefs and expectations and \\nthe assumptions underlying them. \\nThese statements are based on plans, \\nestimates and projections as they are \\ncurrently available to the management \\nof DWS. Forward-looking statements \\ntherefore speak only as of the date they \\nare made, and we undertake no \\nobligation to update publicly any of \\nthem in light of new information or \\nfuture events. \\nBy their very nature, forward-looking \\nstatements involve risks and \\nuncertainties.

Such factors include the \\nconditions in the financial markets in \\nGermany, in Europe, in the United \\nStates and elsewhere from which we \\nderive a substantial portion of our \\nrevenues and in which we hold a \\nsubstantial portion of our assets, the \\ndevelopment of asset prices and market \\nvolatility, the implementation of our \\nstrategic initiatives, the reliability of our \\nrisk management policies, procedures \\nand methods, and other risks as \\ndescribed in this report.
