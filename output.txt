The year 2020 has been exceptional in many ways.
At the beginning of March we presented our new
Corporate Business Plan for 2020-2022 and were
confident that the upward trend we had signaled
would continue. We were also positive about the
longer term as we expect Boskalis to make a
relevant contribution to solutions for the challenges
of the future, in the fields of infrastructure, the
energy transition and the protection of coastal
regions from the impact of climate change.
Sustainability would continue to be a main driver
in delivering these solutions.

Shortly thereafter, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic
became apparent. Lockdown measures were announced across the
globe, working from home became the norm, the aviation industry
came to a grinding halt and as a consequence, keeping our
projects and vessels around the world operational and staffed
became an unprecedented challenge.

The weltare of our employees was our number-one priority
throughout and we immediately introduced measures to safeguarc
safety as well as to ensure the continuity of the projects of our
clients. At the start of the pandemic, the Board of Management ar
our Emergency Response Team convened daily to set priorities.
Together with the Corporate Travel Clinic in the Netherlands, we
established our own testing and travel procedure by mid-April,
allowing us to provide the much needed relief for the vessels and
projects. Some colleagues spent months away from their loved
ones, stranded on a vessel waiting for relief crews, others were at
home longing to get to a project or vessel; and of course many
have been working from home juggling work and personal
priorities. | want to express my great admiration and respect
for the dedication shown by everyone at Boskalis during this
challenging year.

Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we continued with the
execution of our new strategy, launched early 2020, and have
made progress in the last twelve months. Through our sustainability
strategy we support our business strategy and strengthen our
contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For ove
100 years we have been providing services that are essential for
society and I’m proud to say we continue to do so today. Through
our activities, we protect land from the consequences of climate
change, create resilience infrastructure for trade, help keep the
oceans clean and contribute to the energy transition. The vast
majority of our revenue is generated in one of these business
areas and contributes to the achievement of the SDGs.

Climate change sits firmly at the top of the global agenda and we
read with disturbing frequency about floods, and other extreme
weather conditions linked to climate change, in the media.
Protecting against the impact of climate change is an area where
our activities can make a substantial contribution to ‘reversing the
tide’. In 2020 our work began on the new coastal defense
structure in Southsea, UK, that will help reduce the risk of flooding
for more than 10,000 homes and 700 businesses. Our delivery of
coastal protection works in Romania will help counter steady
erosion in the region whilst creating a favorable habitat for local
ecosystems. And we continued our long history of dike protection
in the Netherlands with reinforcements to the protective Houtrib
and Markermeer dikes.

However, we face significant hurdles before climate-adaptive
solutions like these can be scaled up globally. This year we formed
an internal climate adaptation workgroup to address this
challenge as well as to identify and accelerate opportunities that
could add commercial value for our business and create
sustainable protective measures for the environment and
communities living in coastal areas.

Salvage has had one of the busiest and most successful years in its
rich history. The most impactful project took place off the coast of
Sri Lanka. A VLCC tanker carrying two million barrels of crude oil
caught ablaze following an explosion and fire in the engine room.
The fire was controlled and a potentially huge environmental
disaster was averted. The crude tanker was towed to the United
Arab Emirates, where the crude oil cargo was safely transferred to
other vessels.

Our energy transition-related projects continued in 2020, including
acquiring a spectacular contract for the world’s largest floating
wind farm: Kincardine, as well as the contract for the Fecamp wind
farm offshore Normandy, France that is expected to provide enough
electricity to meet the power needs of 770,000 people. The
combination of the heavy transport fleet, our seabed and subsea
capabilities, large anchor handling vessels together with our project
management and engineering skills, uniquely positions Boskalis for
this rapidly growing market.

In 2020, I'm proud to share that we ended the year with a revenue
of EUR 2.5 billion, EBITDA of EUR 404 million and a historically
high order book of EUR 5.3 billion. At the same time, we were able
to substantially improve our strong financial position boasting a net
cash position of EUR 439 million as per year end.

While the COVID-19 pandemic stretched our focus, the urgency of
delivering our economic value in a sustainable manner has never
been higher. We continue our efforts to deliver on our sustainability
ambitions, to enhance the positive impacts of our operations and
minimize the negative. This is reflected in the update of our
sustainability strategy in 2019 and policy commitments in 2020.

In 2020, we made it our ambition to be net climate neutral across
our operations by 2050. Delivering on this will be one of our
biggest challenges in the years to come, but also an area for
significant opportunities. We are actively exploring cleaner fuels,
efficiency improvements and carbon offset as approaches to
mitigate our emissions. We are also focusing on our low-carbon
commercial offering for our clients, incorporating design and
operation emissions reductions into our tenders. Our business in thé
Netherlands is at the forefront of this effort, with 80% of our tender
incorporating a sustainability component. In 2020 we installed
more than 5,000 solar panels on the roof of our distribution center
in the Netherlands, producing 1.6 million kWh of green electricity
per year, or 15% of our domestic needs.

At Boskalis we value the natural environment. In 2020 we had the
honor of establishing collaborations with two international NGOs
to help advance our approach on this topic. We entered into a
collaboration with Wetlands International, an NGO dedicated to
protecting and restoring wetlands around the world. Together we
are exploring the potential of wetland habitat creation for carbon
sequestration. Another important project we initiated this year was
with the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Through
this collaboration we are working to develop best practices in
biodiversity performance planning and monitoring. Based on this
work we have identified biodiversity priorities and clarified our
ambition and objectives as set out in our biodiversity framework.
This is an increasingly important area for society and therefore for
us and our clients. Looking forward we will continue this important
work to improve the way we measure our impact on biodiversity
impacts and the effectiveness of our nature-based solutions.

Despite the COVID-19-imposed restrictions limiting the ability to
interact with communities, we still managed to deliver a number of
community contributions in particular in the areas of safety training
and youth education. We also took this time to focus on social
impact management process and internal capability, updating our
policy, developing training and incorporating new tools into our
Way of Working quality management system. This effort places us
in an ever stronger position to deliver complex projects in a socially
responsible manner.

This year we marked the 10th anniversary of NINA, our successful,
behavior-based safety program. Our planned celebrations were
unfortunately disrupted by the restrictions imposed by the
pandemic, but this should in no way detract from the pride we can
all share in seeing our Lost Time Injury Frequency fall by no less
than 95% in the last 10 years.

After a true roller coaster ride over the last 12 months, | am looking
forward with confidence. We may not be there yet, but thankfully, i
appears as if the end of the pandemic is in sight and as a compan)
we are in great shape. Not only do we have a record high in our
order book, a strong financial position, and the best team of
professionals in the industry, but we are on course to deliver ever
more sustainable solutions to the challenges the world faces today.

On behalf of the Board of Management, | would like to thank all of
our colleagues for their commitment and dedication over the past
year; | have great admiration and respect for the dedication shown
during this challenging year. Furthermore, | would like to thank our
clients, partners and shareholders for the trust and confidence they
place in us.
